    "29": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before and after the change remains the same.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and eggshells. Compost rotting is a chemical change because it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter. A piece of apple turning brown is also a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

Offspring with a hairy fleece must have at least one dominant allele (FF or Ff), while offspring with a woolly fleece must have two recessive alleles (ff).\n\nCounting the boxes, we find:\n- 3 boxes (FF and Ff) with at least one dominant allele\n- 1 box (ff) with two recessive alleles\n\nThus, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 1:3.

To determine which question Farid can investigate, we need to consider what can be tested and measured with these supplies.\n\nOption (A) asks whether a pie crust made with white flour burns more quickly in a glass pan or an aluminum pan. This question can be investigated because Farid has both types of pie pans available.\n\nOption (B) asks whether pie crusts burn less quickly when covered with aluminum foil or left uncovered. However, Farid does not have aluminum foil listed among his supplies, so he cannot investigate this question.\n\nOption (C) asks whether a pie crust made with white flour burns more quickly than a pie crust made with whole wheat flour. Since Farid only has pie crusts made with white flour, he cannot investigate this question either.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "61": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

    "128": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Mixing sand and water is also a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet, but both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating, but mixing sand and water is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent, using the formula: concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up, meaning the matter has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\n\nWhen considering the amount of matter, a larger amount of the same type of matter at the same temperature will have more thermal energy. For example, a 2-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F because it has twice as many atoms. \n\nIn this problem, the two drops of honey are made of the same material and have the same mass.

    "550": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color in pea plants is a trait controlled by a gene with two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's phenotype is its observable trait, determined by its genotype. A dominant allele causes its trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. For example, the F allele for purple flowers is dominant over the f allele for white flowers. A plant with at least one F allele will have purple flowers (FF or Ff). Conversely, a recessive allele's trait appears only when no dominant allele is present. A plant with ff will have white flowers.\n\nIn the context of jaguars, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles: A for a black coat and a for a spotted coat. Hari has the genotype aa, meaning Hari has two recessive alleles. Since the a allele is recessive and Hari has no dominant A alleles, Hari's phenotype will be a spotted coat.\n\nThe answer is a spotted coat.",

    "888": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes, which contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits, on the other hand, are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning, while others, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Trevor has a scar on his right arm. Since scars are acquired traits caused by the environment, we need to determine the cause of Trevor's scar. Option (A) states that some scars fade more quickly than others, which does not provide information about how Trevor acquired his scar. Option (B) states that Trevor's scar was caused by an accident when he cut his arm falling off his bicycle, which clearly indicates that the scar is an acquired trait caused by the environment.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",
    "898": "Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals. Minerals and rocks have the following properties:\n\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\n\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither. Look closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! The properties of dolerite match the properties of a rock. The answer is rock. The answer is B.",

For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of \"disinterested\" means unbiased or impartial. In the context of the given question, we need to determine which text uses \"disinterested\" in this traditional sense. \n\nOption (A) states: \"As a teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell tries to remain disinterested when discussing controversial issues, giving equal attention and consideration to each major viewpoint.\" This usage aligns with the traditional sense of the word, implying that Mr. McDowell is attempting to remain unbiased.\n\nOption (B) states: \"As an experienced teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell believes that playing history-based trivia games will revive even the most disinterested of students.\" Here, \"disinterested\" is used in the sense of uninterested or indifferent, which is a more modern usage.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "1056": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter. Chicken cooking in an oven is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring. \n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Cindy inherited the trait of having straight hair. Option (A) mentions hair color, which is unrelated to the trait in question. Option (B) talks about Cindy's neighbor, who is not a biological relative, so this does not support inheritance. Option (C) mentions Cindy's biological mother, which is relevant, but it does not provide direct evidence of inheritance.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is A.",

    "1286": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Burning a candle is also a chemical change because both the wick and the melted wax burn, reacting with oxygen in the air and turning into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Burning is caused by heating, but a piece of pizza rotting is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths. Look at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The cougar uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The marmot has large front teeth.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies! Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Water evaporating is a physical change.

Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter. Ice melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Ice melting is caused by heating. But erosion is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is D.",

    "1714": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a particular trait is determined by its genotype. The genotype consists of alleles, which can be either dominant or recessive. The dominant allele will mask the presence of a recessive allele in the phenotype. For the body size trait in rats, the allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B).\n\nTo determine the expected phenotype ratio, we use a Punnett square. This square helps predict the types of offspring a cross can produce. For a cross between two heterozygous rats (Bb x Bb), the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n | B | b\nB | BB | Bb\nb | Bb | bb\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype BB, 2 boxes with the genotype Bb, and 1 box with the genotype bb. Offspring with a normal-sized body will have the genotype BB or Bb, while those with a dwarf body will have the genotype bb.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 boxes representing offspring with a normal-sized body (BB and Bb) and 1 box representing offspring with a dwarf body (bb). The expected phenotype ratio is 3:1.\n\nThe answer is E.",

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is B.\"\n\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\n\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\n\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\n\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\n\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\n\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\n\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\n\nYou need to determine Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait. First, consider the alleles in Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nThe allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.\n\nDolly has the genotype gg for the coat graying gene. An organism with two recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dolly will have the version of the coat graying trait that is associated with the recessive allele.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "2382": "Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals. Minerals and rocks have the following properties:\n\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\n\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither. Look closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nScoria has the following properties: no fixed crystal structure, has many small holes, not a pure substance, found in nature, solid, not made by organisms. These properties match the properties of a rock. The answer is A.",

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. Arms, legs, flippers, and wings are different types of limbs. The type of limbs an animal has is an example of an adaptation. Animals' limbs can be adapted in different ways. For example, long legs might help an animal run fast. Flippers might help an animal swim. Wings might help an animal fly.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The context mentions that gray herons live near marshes, rivers, and lakes and eat frogs and fish that live in shallow water. Gray herons hunt their prey by walking through water, or wading. The picture of the gray heron shows long legs that help keep its body above the surface of the water while wading. Thin legs are easier to move through the water.\n\nNext, let's look at each animal to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The painted stork has long, thin legs. Its legs are adapted for wading. The common kingfisher has short legs. Its legs are not adapted for wading. The common kingfisher uses its legs to walk and perch.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "2531": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Rust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change. Oxygen in the air reacts with iron in the bike frame. The outside of the frame turns into a different type of matter called rust. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change.

For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\n\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.\n\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.\n\nBy comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height. In this experiment, Susan investigated whether adding worms to compost containers affects how well food breaks down. The containers that did not get worms serve as a control group. The answer is A.",

    "2638": "Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space and can come in different states or forms. When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. A solid has a size and shape of its own. Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken, like a piece of paper or a grain of sand.\n\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. A liquid takes the shape of its container but maintains its volume. For example, juice poured from a bottle into a cup still takes up the same amount of space but changes shape.\n\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or shape. A gas expands to fill its container completely and can also be compressed into a smaller space. Many gases are invisible, such as the oxygen we breathe or the helium in a balloon.\n\nA rubber balloon is a gas.

    "2779": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, while its phenotype is the observable version of that trait. For instance, a pea plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers, while ff will result in white flowers. Traits controlled by a single gene can be homozygous (two identical alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles).\n\nDominant alleles cause their version of the trait to appear even when a recessive allele is present. For instance, B is a dominant allele for green body feathers in budgerigar parakeets, while b is recessive for blue body feathers. Iago, being homozygous for the recessive bb genotype, will express the recessive trait.\n\nTherefore, Iago's phenotype for the body feather color trait is blue body feathers. The answer is A.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break.

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is A.",

    "2983": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of green particles per milliliter.\n\nAfter analyzing the diagram, it is evident that Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. Therefore, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles. The answer is C.",

Temperature can be measured in degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) or Celsius (\u00b0C). For reference, water boils at 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C), body temperature is around 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), room temperature is approximately 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C), and water freezes at 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C).\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. A cup of hot cocoa is typically made with milk, sugar, and cocoa powder. The temperature of this mixture should be hot enough to melt the sugar and warm up the milk, but not so hot that it boils over. Given that water boils at 70\u00b0C (158\u00b0F) and hot cocoa is served in a cup, it is reasonable to estimate that the temperature of a cup of hot cocoa is around 70\u00b0C.\n\nIn conclusion, the better estimate for the temperature of a cup of hot cocoa is 70\u00b0C.

    "3377": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent, using the formula: concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, we need to look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of purple particles per milliliter.\n\nAfter analyzing the diagram, it is clear that Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles. The answer is Solution A.",

Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. Several factors can influence the overall supply, causing it to go up or down. For instance, supply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get, when there are more producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go up. Conversely, supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The table below shows how changes to these factors might affect overall supply:\n\n- Supply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get, when there are more producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go up.\n- Supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down.\n\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services, while suppliers are those who sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly, often increasing supply. \n\nIn this scenario, four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, reducing the number of suppliers. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the supply of men's shirts probably went down. \n\nThe answer is B.",

    "3504": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it lands on the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is D.",

The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets. Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater. There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is A.",

The allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f). To determine an organism's phenotype for a trait, look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype. If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele, the phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the trait. If the genotype has only recessive alleles, the phenotype will be the recessive allele's version.\n\nA Punnett square shows the types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\n\nConsider the Punnett square below:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2. To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The F allele for black fur is dominant over the f allele for brown fur.\n\nBlack fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. Offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff. All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff. Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. Offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff. There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\n\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 4:0. This means that this cross will always produce offspring with black fur and never produce offspring with brown fur. The answer is D.",

    "3750": "Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms, which are always moving. The energy of these moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down, resulting in less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\n\nGiven that the two bowls of oatmeal are made of the same material and have the same mass, the bowl of oatmeal with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature. This is because the atoms in the bowl with less thermal energy are moving more slowly, leading to a lower temperature.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "4548": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. The rose plant in question does not have thorns and has two alleles for not having thorns. Therefore, the plant's genotype is rr. The observable version of the thorns trait is not having thorns, which is the plant's phenotype.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is not having thorns.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents the compound pyrite. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces, but each piece is still made of paper. Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes.

Thermal energy is the energy possessed by an object due to the motion of its atoms or molecules. It depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and the temperature of the matter. Temperature measures how hot or cold an object is, and it is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules in the object.\n\nGiven that both bath towels are identical in material and mass, the key difference is their temperature. The hotter bath towel has atoms that are moving faster, which means it has more thermal energy. Conversely, the colder bath towel has atoms that are moving slower, resulting in less thermal energy.\n\nTherefore, the hotter bath towel has more thermal energy. The answer is A.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Bleaching clothes is a chemical change.

Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. When the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution, equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, solute particles continue to move, but their overall concentration remains the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, the solution is divided by a permeable membrane, allowing solute particles to move freely between the two sides. Initially, there are 5 solute particles on the left side and 3 on the right side of the membrane. To reach equilibrium, the solute particles must move such that there are 4 particles on each side.\n\nAnalyzing the movement, more solute particles must have moved from the left side (higher concentration) to the right side (lower concentration) to achieve this balance. Therefore, the correct completion of the text is: \"Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

    "6188": "A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought and has both a subject and a verb. For example, \"My friends walk along the path\" is a complete sentence. In contrast, a sentence fragment does not express a complete thought and is usually missing a subject or a verb, such as \"Knows the answer,\" which is missing a subject.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n(A) \"Over the summer, my cousin Reba visited many times.\" This is a complete sentence. It has a subject (\"my cousin Reba\") and a verb (\"visited\"). The phrase \"Over the summer\" is an introductory phrase that adds information but does not alter the fact that the sentence has both a subject and a verb.\n(B) \"Beavers build a dam they use sticks and branches.\" This is a sentence fragment. It lacks a subject and does not express a complete thought.\n\nThe answer is A.",

To determine the probability that a horse produced by this cross will have a reddish-brown coat, we need to analyze the Punnett square for the cross.\n\nA Punnett square is a tool used to predict the genotypes of offspring from a particular genetic cross. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype for the offspring. Since the allele for black coat color (L) is dominant over the allele for reddish-brown coat color (l), any genotype with at least one L allele will result in a black coat color. Only a genotype of ll will result in a reddish-brown coat color.\n\nLet's analyze the Punnett square for the cross:\n```\n   L   l\nL  LL  Ll\nl  Ll  ll\n```\nThere is one box with the genotype ll, which means there is one way to get a reddish-brown coat color. There are four possible outcomes, so the probability of getting a reddish-brown coat color is:\n\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 1 / 4\n\nThe answer is 1/4.",

The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus, which is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species, and the second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species.\n\nFor example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws, but Ursus maritimus has white fur, and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nA black-tailed jackrabbit's scientific name is Lepus californicus. Erinaceus europaeus does not have the same scientific name as a black-tailed jackrabbit, so Lepus californicus and Erinaceus europaeus are not in the same species.

These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior, and may have different alleles that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff. The phenotype is the observable trait, such as purple or white flowers, determined by the genotype.\n\nSome traits are controlled by a single gene with two alleles, and an organism's genotype must be homozygous or heterozygous for the gene to have that trait. For instance, in pea plants, the phenotype for flower color is purple only when the plant has at least one F allele (FF or Ff). Blue body feathers in budgerigar parakeets is a similar case, where the allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). Chirpie has the heterozygous genotype Bb, meaning it has one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b).

    "6457": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.

The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed. The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Tammy started sledding. As Tammy rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased.

    "6779": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies! A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "6981": "A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem. In a food web, arrows show the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten and points to the organism that is doing the eating. Producers do not eat other organisms, so they do not have arrows pointing to them from other organisms.\n\nTo determine which organism is the producer in this food web, we need to look for the organism that does not have any arrows pointing to it. The silver maple has arrows pointing to it, so it is not a producer. The pine vole also has arrows pointing to it, so it is not a producer. The beaver has one arrow pointing to it, but it is still an animal that eats other organisms, so it is not a producer. The gray fox has arrows pointing to it, so it is not a producer.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "7007": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before and after the change remains the same.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change because the tablet and water form a different type of matter. Burning food on a stove is also a chemical change because the type of matter in the food changes when it burns, turning black and giving off smoke.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Burning is caused by heating, but an antacid tablet reacting with water is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed. The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Julia started sledding. As Julia rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Julia rode down the hill. The answer is C.",

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance. The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy. Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B. Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature. The answer is sample A.",

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion. As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\n\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\n\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before.

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is B.\"\n\nIn a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion. As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\n\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\n\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 3 solute particles on the right side of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths. Look at the picture of the sand tiger shark. The sand tiger shark has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted for tearing through meat. The sand tiger shark uses its teeth to cut up meat into pieces it can swallow. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The starry moray has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted for tearing through meat. The parrotfish has a small mouth and small teeth. Its mouth is not adapted for tearing through meat. The parrotfish uses its mouth to eat corals. The answer is B.",

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem. Each arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten and points to the living thing that is doing the eating.\n\nOmnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. Therefore, in a food web, omnivores will have arrows pointing to them from at least one producer and at least one consumer. For the kelp bass, there is an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer, and another arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton, which is a consumer. This indicates that the kelp bass eats both a producer and a consumer, making it an omnivore.\n\nOn the other hand, the zooplankton has only one arrow pointing to it, from the phytoplankton, which is a producer. This indicates that the zooplankton is a consumer but not an omnivore because it does not eat other consumers.\n\nThe answer is A.",

Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's phenotype is its observable trait, determined by its genotype. A dominant allele causes its trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. For example, the F allele for purple flowers is dominant over the f allele for white flowers. A plant with FF or Ff will have purple flowers. Conversely, a recessive allele's trait appears only when no dominant allele is present, so a plant with ff will have white flowers.\n\nIn the context of summer squash plants, the gene for leaf texture has two alleles: L for fuzzy leaves (dominant) and l for smooth leaves (recessive).

Conditioned responses occur when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. There are two types of conditioned responses: classical conditioning and operant conditioning. In classical conditioning, an animal learns to associate an unconditioned response with a conditioned stimulus. In operant conditioning, a behavior is linked with a reward or punishment that is under the animal's voluntary control.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem in detail. The text describes how an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\n\nThe text also mentions operant conditioning, which is a process like classical conditioning. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the term that matches the picture is operant conditioning.

    "8321": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Beating an egg is a physical change. The egg breaks into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture.

In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green. Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a physical change. The heat causes the clay pot to change state. The clay pot becomes harder and more brittle. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.

    "8581": "A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought, containing both a subject and a verb. For example, \"My friends walk along the path.\" A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma. For instance, \"I knocked on the door it opened\" and \"It started raining, we ran inside\" are run-on sentences.\n\nTo fix a run-on sentence, you can separate it into two sentences by adding end punctuation after the first sentence and capitalizing the second sentence. For example, \"I knocked on the door. It opened.\" or \"It started raining. We ran inside.\" Another way to fix a run-on sentence is by rewriting it as a compound sentence, joining the two sentences with a comma and a conjunction such as \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or,\" or \"so.\" For example, \"I knocked on the door, and it opened.\" or \"It started raining, so we ran inside.\"\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n(A) \"The class chuckles at Ms. McKee's joke.\" - This is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb.\n(B) \"Sharon fell asleep Mom put a blanket on her.\" - This is a run-on sentence because it contains two sentences joined without end punctuation: \"Sharon fell asleep\" and \"Mom put a blanket on her.\"\n\nThe answer is B.",

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is D.\"\n\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This is a physical change. The solid state of dry ice changes to a gas state. But the carbon dioxide remains the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Dry ice becoming a gas is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. The answer is D.",

If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.\n\nTo determine if there is a net force on the ice cube, look at the forces: Earth's gravity is pulling the ice cube down with a force of 0.1 N. The water is pushing the ice cube up with a force of 0.1 N. The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 0.1 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "8785": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring. Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Dakota's green eyes are an inherited trait. Option (A) states that Dakota has green eyes like her biological mother, which supports the conclusion that the trait was inherited.

Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is C.\"\n\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed. Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and water is a physical change.

    "9650": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\n\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\n\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.\n\nStep 1: Interpret the model. Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model. You can see from the model that a molecule of hydrogen gas is composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded together.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound. You know from Step 1 that hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element. So, hydrogen is an elementary substance.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The space-filling model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride. In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. Use the model to determine whether iodine is an elementary substance or a compound.\n\nStep 1: Interpret the model. Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model. You can see from the model that a molecule of iodine is composed of one chemical element.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound. You know from Step 1 that iodine is composed of only one chemical element. So, iodine is an elementary substance.\n\nThe answer is A.",

The arrows in a food web indicate the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another. Each arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten and points to the living thing that is doing the eating. Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers, so they have arrows pointing to them from at least one producer and at least one consumer.\n\nIn the given food web, the plainfin midshipman has arrows pointing to it from the phytoplankton (a producer) and the zooplankton (a consumer), indicating that it eats both producers and consumers. Therefore, the plainfin midshipman is an omnivore. On the other hand, the phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it, indicating that it is not an omnivore.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "9874": "To determine if the statement about the volume of Mars being more than three times as large as Mercury's is true or false, we need to understand the volumes of these planets. The volume of a planet indicates its size. In our solar system, planets are primarily composed of rock, gas, or ice. \n\nFirst, let's calculate three times the volume of Mercury. The volume of Mercury is approximately 6.083 x 10^10 cubic kilometers. Therefore, three times this volume is 3 x 6.083 x 10^10, which equals approximately 1.825 x 10^11 cubic kilometers.\n\nNext, compare this result to the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is approximately 1.6318 x 10^11 cubic kilometers. Since 1.6318 x 10^11 cubic kilometers is less than 1.825 x 10^11 cubic kilometers, the volume of Mars is not more than three times the volume of Mercury.\n\nThe answer is false. The answer is A.",
    "9883": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. If the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nIn this case, the whale swam toward the surface of the water. As the whale swam, the distance between the whale and the center of Earth decreased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the whale and Earth decreased as the whale swam toward the surface. The answer is C.",

    "9891": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of the word \"ironic\" is something that happens in a way that is contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. In the second text, Levi took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather, and in an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week. This situation is ironic because Levi tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.\n\nIn contrast, the first text uses \"ironic\" in a nontraditional sense, marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Levi's friends were in Florida the week before he arrived.\n\nMost style guides recommend avoiding the nontraditional sense of the word \"ironic\" because it is generally considered incorrect.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "10103": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread! Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Melting glass is a physical change. But baking a loaf of bread is not. Both are chemical changes. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. But melting glass is not. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating.

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait. If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\n\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\n\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n\nTo determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.\n\nSweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff. There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\n\nSour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\n\nLook closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts, so body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too, so substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is B.\"\n\nMatter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Snails growing shells is a physical change. As a snail grows, the top of its body forms a shell. The shell is made of the same type of matter as the snail. Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a commensal relationship, one organism benefits while the other is not significantly affected. In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit. In a parasitic relationship, one organism benefits at the expense of the other.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. When an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby, the goby acts as a lookout for the shrimp, warning it of predators. This interaction helps both the shrimp and the goby survive. Therefore, both the shrimp and the goby benefit from this relationship.\n\nFinally, we conclude that the relationship formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby is mutualistic. The answer is C.",

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is C.\"\n\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water in the puddle becomes ice. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. Beating an egg is a physical change. The egg breaks and turns into a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the unbeaten egg.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing is caused by cooling. But beating an egg is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "10797": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional usage of \"unique\" means being the only one of its kind. In the first text, \"Jon custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Lancaster,\" the word \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense because the coffee table is custom-ordered and one of a kind. In the second text, \"Jon bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Lancaster,\" the word \"unique\" is used in a nontraditional sense, implying that the coffee table is interesting or unusual, but not necessarily one of a kind.\n\nThe answer is A.",

Genes, which are pieces of hereditary material, contain instructions for building parts of an organism and affect its observable traits. Genes can have different alleles that cause different versions of a trait. An organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, and its phenotype is the observable version of that trait.\n\nIn the context of fruit flies, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles: N (normal wings) and n (vestigial wings). The allele for normal wings (N) is dominant over the allele for vestigial wings (n). Therefore, an organism with at least one N allele will have normal wings, while only an organism with two n alleles will have vestigial wings.\n\nGiven that the fruit fly in question has a heterozygous genotype Nn, it has one dominant allele (N) and one recessive allele (n). Since the dominant allele (N) causes normal wings to appear even when a recessive allele (n) is present, the fruit fly's phenotype will be normal wings.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "11006": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change. The tarnish reacts with the polish and turns into a different type of matter, which can be wiped away. A piece of avocado turning brown is also a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nHematite has all the properties of a mineral. So, hematite is a mineral. The answer is B.",
    "11201": "In fruit flies, the gene for antenna type has two alleles: the dominant allele for mutated antennae (A) and the recessive allele for normal antennae (a). To determine the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to those with normal antennae, we use a Punnett square to analyze the cross between two heterozygous flies (Aa x Aa).\n\nThe Punnett square for this cross is as follows:\n | A | a\nA | AA | Aa\na | Aa | aa\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype AA, 2 boxes with the genotype Aa, and 1 box with the genotype aa. Offspring with mutated antennae (AA and Aa) total 3 boxes, while offspring with normal antennae (aa) total 1 box.\n\nThus, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 3:1. The answer is C.",
    "11202": "In genetics, genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism and affect its observable traits, including flower color. Genes may have different alleles that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, the gene for flower color in scarlet rosemallow plants has two alleles: F for red flowers and f for white flowers. The allele F is dominant over the allele f. \n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, and its phenotype is the observable version of that trait. A plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have the phenotype of red flowers because the dominant allele F will mask the presence of the recessive allele f. Conversely, a plant with the genotype ff will have the phenotype of white flowers because it has two recessive alleles.\n\nGiven that the scarlet rosemallow plant in question has the homozygous genotype ff, it has two recessive alleles. Since the f allele is recessive and there are no dominant alleles present, the plant's phenotype will be white flowers.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "11206": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms. Step 2: Interpret the problem. Potassium chloride is composed of two chemical elements: potassium and chlorine. The chemical formula for potassium chloride, KCl, contains two atomic symbols: K for potassium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that potassium chloride is a compound. Step 3: Give a conclusion. The answer is A.",

    "11480": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nFirst, think about each change. Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nNext, look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles. The answer is A.",

    "11932": "This is a choice question. First, scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words. The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws, but Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem. A pickerel frog's scientific name is Lithobates palustris. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates. Agalychnis callidryas is in the genus Agalychnis. The first word of its scientific name is Agalychnis. So, Agalychnis callidryas and Lithobates palustris are not in the same genus. Bufo guttatus is in the genus Bufo. The first word of its scientific name is Bufo. So, Bufo guttatus and Lithobates palustris are not in the same genus. Lithobates catesbeianus is in the genus Lithobates. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates. So, Lithobates catesbeianus and Lithobates palustris are in the same genus.\n\nThe answer is A.",

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes, which contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits, on the other hand, are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Brianna has a scar on her left leg. Since scars are acquired traits caused by the environment, we need to determine the cause of Brianna's scar. The options given are: (A) Some scars fade more quickly than others and (B) Brianna's scar was caused by an accident. She cut her leg when she was climbing a tree.

The gene for wing type in fruit flies has two alleles: the dominant allele for normal wings (N) and the recessive allele for vestigial wings (n). \n\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a possible genotype outcome from the cross of two parents. Since the allele for normal wings (N) is dominant, it will appear in the genotype of the offspring even if only one parent has the dominant allele. Therefore, the Punnett square for this cross would look like this:\n\n | N | n\nN | NN | Nn\nn | Nn | nn\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we see that there are four possible outcomes: NN, Nn, Nn, and nn. Out of these, three outcomes (NN, Nn, and Nn) result in normal wings, while one outcome (nn) results in vestigial wings.\n\nThe probability of an offspring having normal wings is calculated by the number of ways the event can happen (3) divided by the total number of equally likely outcomes (4):\n\n3/4\n\nThe answer is 3/4.",

Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day. Water evaporates when liquid water changes into a gas. The water vaporizes. A puddle on the ground might dry up. The water changes state from liquid to gas. This is a change of state. A different type of matter is not formed. Rain forms when water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets. When the droplets hit the ground, they become water again. This is a cycle. The water vapor in the air is condensed into liquid water. When the liquid water hits the ground, it forms a puddle. Both changes are chemical changes. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Both changes are physical changes. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. Both changes are caused by heating.

    "12399": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cooking an egg is a chemical change because the heat causes the matter in the egg to change, resulting in cooked eggs and raw eggs being made of different types of matter. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change because the penny reacts with oxygen in the air, forming a different type of matter on the surface of the penny.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.

    "12549": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\n\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\n\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\n\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.\n\nYou can tell whether nitrogen is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for nitrogen, N2, contains one atomic symbol: N. So, the formula tells you that nitrogen is composed of only one chemical element. Since nitrogen is composed of only one chemical element, nitrogen is an elementary substance.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "12553": "This is a choice question. First, scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words. The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nNext, a sand cat's scientific name is Felis margarita. The first word of its scientific name is Felis. Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx rufus and Felis margarita are not in the same genus. Felis margarita is in the genus Felis. The first word of its scientific name is Felis. So, Felis margarita and Lynx canadensis are in the same genus. The first word of Lynx canadensis's scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx canadensis and Felis margarita are not in the same species within their genus. Felis margarita has the species name margarita. Lynx canadensis has the species name canadensis. Both organisms have small round ears and sharp claws. But Felis margarita has white fur and Lynx canadensis has gray fur.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter. Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not make a different type of matter. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is A.",

The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation. Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change as it does not form a different type of matter. Water freezing into ice is a change of state, so it is a physical change.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be. The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol. The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula. The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms. You can tell whether gallium arsenide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for gallium arsenide is GaAs. This formula contains two symbols: Ga for gallium and As for arsenic. So, the formula tells you that gallium arsenide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.

    "13007": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Your saliva breaks the bread down into a softer, sweeter type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "13202": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering the question. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily, while a short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The Allen's hummingbird has a long, thin beak adapted to get nectar out of long flowers. This beak shape allows it to reach deep into flowers to access nectar. To solve the problem, we need to identify which bird has a similar adaptation.\n\nThe green violetear has a long, thin beak adapted to get nectar out of long flowers, similar to the Allen's hummingbird. On the other hand, the secretary bird has a sharp hooked beak, which is not adapted to get nectar out of long flowers but is used to eat small mammals and birds.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "13204": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other: At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other. At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other. At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust. Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.\n\nTo figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Cascade Range, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. The passage explains that the Cascade Range is a volcanic arc in the Pacific Northwest that begins in California and runs north into British Columbia. As the North American Plate and the Juan de Fuca Plate move toward each other, oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts, or sinks, below continental crust of the North American Plate. There are eighteen volcanoes in the Cascade Range, and some of them are still active. Mount St. Helens is an active volcano near Seattle, Washington. It last erupted in May of 1980.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. The underlined part of the passage explains that the Cascade Range formed as the two plates moved toward each other. So, the Cascade Range formed at a convergent boundary. The answer is C.",
    "13210": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Getting a haircut is a physical change. Your hair is shorter after a haircut, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log gets shorter, but it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut log.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be. The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol. The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula. The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms. You can tell whether lithium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for lithium bromide is LiBr. This formula contains two symbols: Li for lithium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that lithium bromide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. The answer is a compound.

    "13652": "This is a choice question. First, scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words. The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws, but Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem. An agile wallaby's scientific name is Macropus agilis. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus. Lacerta agilis is in the genus Lacerta. The first word of its scientific name is Lacerta. So, Lacerta agilis and Macropus agilis are not in the same genus. Ictinia mississippiensis is in the genus Ictinia. The first word of its scientific name is Ictinia. So, Ictinia mississippiensis and Macropus agilis are not in the same genus. Macropus agilis and Lacerta agilis are in the same genus, but they are not in the same species.\n\nThe answer is C.",

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\n\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is B.\"\n\nIn a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion. As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\n\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\n\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 3 solute particles on the right side of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.\n\nThe answer is B.",

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger. The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait. If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\n\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce.

So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n\nTo determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.\n\nBlack eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A Punnett square must have only 1 box with the genotype aa if it produces offspring with the recessive allele's version of the trait. The Punnett square in the problem has 1 box with the genotype aa. So, it produces offspring with black eyes.\n\nRed eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A Punnett square must have 2 boxes with the genotype EE or 2 boxes with the genotype Ee if it produces offspring with the dominant allele's version of the trait. The Punnett square in the problem has 3 boxes with the genotype EE and 1 box with the genotype Ee. So, it produces offspring with red eyes.\n\nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square representing offspring with red eyes. So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 1:3.

    "14324": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture, and making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",
    "14327": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, such as FF, Ff, or ff for flower color. The phenotype is the observable version of the trait, depending on the genotype. A pea plant may have purple or white flowers based on its genotype.\n\nSome traits are controlled by a single gene, with organisms having two alleles for these traits. These alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous (two identical alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles). The types of alleles in the genotype determine the phenotype. Dominant alleles cause their version of the trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present, while recessive alleles cause their version to appear only if no dominant allele is present.\n\nIn the context of cucumber plants, the gene for fruit texture has two alleles: F for bumpy fruit and f for smooth fruit. The plant in question has the genotype FF, meaning it has two dominant alleles for bumpy fruit. Therefore, the plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait is bumpy fruit.\n\nThe answer is A.",

The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G). To determine an organism's phenotype for a trait, look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype. If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele, the phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the trait. If the genotype has only recessive alleles, the phenotype will be the recessive allele's version.\n\nA Punnett square shows the types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\n\nConsider the Punnett square below:\n | G | g\nG | GG | Gg\ng | Gg | gg\n\nThere is 1 box with the genotype GG, 2 boxes with the genotype Gg, and 1 box with the genotype gg. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype GG to those with gg is 1:2. To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait.\n\nA watermelon plant with at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color trait will have a yellow ground spot. So, offspring with the genotype GG or Gg will have a yellow ground spot. There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg.

Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is B.\"\n\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Ice melting in a glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "15497": "In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight whiskers and others have curved whiskers. The gene for the whisker type trait has two alleles: the allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). Stuart is a Syrian hamster with the homozygous genotype hh for the whisker type gene.\n\nTo determine Stuart's phenotype, we need to understand the relationship between the alleles. Since the allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive, it will only express the curved whisker phenotype when two copies are present. Stuart's genotype of hh means he has two recessive alleles.\n\nGiven that Stuart's genotype is hh, and the h allele is recessive, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers. The answer is A.",

    "15512": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\n\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nIn the context of deer mice, the body hair trait is determined by two alleles: B for a hairy body and b for a hairless body. Remy has one allele for a hairy body (B) and one allele for a hairless body (b), which means Remy's genotype is Bb. Since the allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive, Remy's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairless body.\n\nThe answer is a hairless body.",

Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is B.\"\n\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter. Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Wax melting is caused by heating. But knitting yarn into a scarf is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air, breaking the chemical bonds in the molecules and forming different molecules like carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state, so it is a physical change.

These genes affect observable traits, including appearance. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. An organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, and its phenotype is the observable version of that trait.\n\nIn the context of the Nile tilapia fish, the gene for body color has two alleles: B (greenish-brown body) and b (pink body). The allele B is dominant over the allele b. Therefore, a fish with the genotype BB or Bb will have a greenish-brown body, while a fish with the genotype bb will have a pink body.\n\nGiven that the Nile tilapia fish in question has the homozygous genotype bb, it has two recessive alleles. Since the b allele is recessive and there are no dominant B alleles present, the fish's phenotype will be the version of the trait associated with the b allele, which is a pink body.\n\nThe answer is a pink body.",

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words. The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nA great egret's scientific name is Ardea alba. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.

    "16574": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, such as FF, Ff, or ff for flower color. The phenotype is the observable version of the trait, which depends on the genotype.

These alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous (two identical alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles). The types of alleles in the genotype determine the phenotype. Dominant alleles cause their version of the trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present, while recessive alleles cause their version to appear only if no dominant allele is present.\n\nIn the context of cockatiels, the gene for cheek color has two alleles: R for bright orange cheeks (dominant) and r for pale orange cheeks (recessive).

    "16678": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. The metallic nickel on the outside of the penny reacts with sulfur in the air to form a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\n\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.\n\nYou need to determine Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait. First, consider the alleles in Elijah's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m). This means M is a dominant allele, and m is a recessive allele. Elijah's genotype of mm has two recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.

    "17209": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms, which can link together by chemical bonds to form molecules. In a chemical change, these chemical bonds break, and the atoms rearrange to form different molecules, resulting in a change in the type of matter. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper molecules react with oxygen to form new molecules like carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules remain the same. Changes of state, such as water vaporizing, are examples of physical changes caused by heating or cooling.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change because the heat causes the proteins in the chicken to denature, resulting in a different type of matter. Burning a marshmallow is also a chemical change because the heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change, making it black and crispy.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Both changes are caused by heating.

    "17391": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms, which can link together by chemical bonds to form molecules. In a chemical change, these chemical bonds break, and the atoms link together to form new molecules, resulting in different types of molecules before and after the change. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change where paper molecules react with oxygen to form new molecules like carbon dioxide.\n\nIn contrast, a physical change does not involve breaking chemical bonds, and the types of molecules remain the same before and after the change. A change of state, such as water vaporizing, is a physical change because liquid water and water vapor are both made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nWhen a can of soda fizzes over, the carbon dioxide gas in the soda forms bubbles and rises to the surface, creating a physical change. The gas leaves the soda, but it remains a different type of matter. Therefore, the can of soda fizzing over is a physical change.\n\nThe answer is physical change.",

    "17408": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\n\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\n\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

    "17435": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. A dinosaur bone turning into rock is a chemical change. The type of matter in the bone changes. The rock is a different type of matter than the bone. A dinosaur bone is made of bone matter. A rock is made of mineral matter. When the bone dies, the minerals in the bone start to change the bone into rock. This change takes millions of years. The process is called geochronology. Exposure to air helps the change happen. Polish is a liquid. When you rub polish onto a silver spoon, the polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter. The polish and tarnish are different types of matter before and after this change.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. Both changes are chemical changes. The answer is A.",

These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, while its phenotype is the observable trait. In the context of guinea pigs, the gene for eye color has two alleles: E for brown eyes and e for red eyes. Tiny has red eyes, indicating he has two alleles for red eyes (e). Therefore, Tiny's genotype for the eye color gene is ee.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "17611": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid but remains the same type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state, so it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into liquid water and falls to the ground as rain, but the water vapor and the rain are both made of water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Wax melting is caused by heating, but rain forming in a cloud is not. Both are caused by cooling. Rain forms when water vapor in the air condenses and falls to the ground, which is caused by cooling, but melting wax is not.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "18036": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation. Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change because a change of state does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating, but crushing a mineral into powder is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is A.",

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words. The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nA moon jellyfish's scientific name is Aurelia aurita. Aequorea victoria does not have the same scientific name as a moon jellyfish. So, Aurelia aurita and Aequorea victoria are not in the same species. Aurelia aurita has the same scientific name as a moon jellyfish. So, these organisms are in the same species. Cyanea capillata does not have the same scientific name as a moon jellyfish. So, Aurelia aurita and Cyanea capillata are not in the same species.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",

    "18349": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. For instance, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm, skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators, and skin with thick scales might help an animal survive a fall from a tree.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. The giant pangolin has hard scales on its skin, which are adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth. These scales make it difficult for predators to hurt or kill the giant pangolin. We need to determine which of the given animals has a similar adaptation.\n\nThe nine-banded armadillo has hard scales on its skin, similar to the giant pangolin. Its skin is adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth. On the other hand, the Grant's gazelle has soft fur covering its skin, which is not adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth.\n\nThe answer is B.",

These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, while its phenotype is the observable trait. In the context of the coat color gene in horses, the gene has two alleles: L for a black coat and l for a reddish-brown coat. Boxer, a horse with a black coat, has one allele for a black coat (L) and one allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). Therefore, Boxer's genotype for the coat color gene is Ll.\n\nThe answer is A.",

By doing this, the essay will have a clear main idea, and the reader will have a better understanding of the topic.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "18572": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together. Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger. The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is B.",

    "18892": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple. A sidewalk heating up in the sun is a physical change. The temperature of the sidewalk goes up, but the sidewalk is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. A sidewalk getting warm in the sun is caused by heating. But cutting an apple is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is mostly plain scales.\"\n\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene. An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene. An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\n\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\n\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\n\nYou need to determine Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait. First, consider the alleles in Poseidon's genotype for the iridescent scales gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele. Poseidon's genotype of ii means Poseidon has two recessive alleles for the iridescent scales gene. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales. The answer is mostly plain scales.",

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent, using the formula: concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, we need to look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. The question asks which information supports the conclusion that Austin inherited his hazel eyes. Option (A) mentions that Austin and his sisters wear glasses, which is not relevant to the trait in question. Option (C) states that Austin's friend has hazel eyes, but friends are not biologically related, so this does not support inheritance.

In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of green particles per milliliter.\n\nAfter analyzing the diagram, it is clear that Solution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter. Therefore, their concentrations are the same. The answer is neither; their concentrations are the same. The answer is A.",

    "20095": "Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals. Minerals and rocks have the following properties: they are solids, formed in nature, not made by organisms, pure substances, and have a fixed crystal structure. You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\n\nLook closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts, so body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too, so substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals. A shark's tooth is made by a living thing. All minerals are formed in nature, but they are not made by living things. A shark's tooth is not a pure substance, but all minerals are pure substances. So, a shark's tooth is not a mineral. Chrysotile is a pure substance. All minerals are pure substances. So, chrysotile is a mineral. Muscovite is a pure substance. All minerals are pure substances. So, muscovite is a mineral.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. Bending a paper clip is a physical change. The paper clip gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

Minerals and rocks have the following properties:\n\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\n\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither. Look closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals. A shark's tooth is a solid and formed in nature, but it is made by a living thing. So, a shark's tooth is not a mineral. Chalcopyrite is a mineral. Quartz is a mineral. The answer is C.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change.

A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log gets shorter, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Stretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "20518": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\n\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

This cell wall provides structural support and protection, similar to the way a skeleton supports and protects an animal cell. The cell wall is made of cellulose, a tough, waterproof material that gives it strength and stiffness. Chromosomes are used for genetic information storage and are not involved in giving strength and stiffness to the cell. The Golgi apparatus is responsible for packaging proteins and other substances, not for giving strength and stiffness. The cytoplasm is the gel-like substance inside the cell that helps maintain the cell's shape, but it does not give it strength or stiffness. Therefore, the part whose main job is to give strength and stiffness to a plant cell is the cell wall. The answer is cell wall.",

Acquired traits are gained during a person's life, either through learning or environmental factors.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. In this case, we need to determine which option supports the conclusion that Kaylee inherited her trait. Option (A) states that Kaylee's parents have red hair and passed down this trait to Kaylee. This aligns with the definition of inherited traits. Option (B) mentions that Kaylee and her mother both wear their hair in braids, which is an acquired trait and not inherited.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is A.",
    "21121": "When answering a question about the capital of a state, it's important to distinguish between the capital city and other major cities within the state. In the case of Washington, many might confuse Seattle, the largest city, with the capital. However, the capital of Washington is Olympia. This choice was made when the Washington territory was created in 1853, with Olympia being selected due to its strategic location. The Washington State Capitol in Olympia houses the government of the state. Therefore, after analyzing the options provided, the correct answer is D. The answer is Olympia.",
    "21128": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time, and it can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day. Climate, on the other hand, is the pattern of weather in a certain place over a long period. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. The passage states, \"Where Nicole lives, winter is the rainiest season of the year.\" This tells you about the usual precipitation where Nicole lives, not what the weather is like on a particular day. \n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is climate. The answer is B.",
    "21133": "To determine whether the helium in balloons is a solid, a liquid, or a gas, we need to understand the states of matter. Matter can exist in three primary states: solid, liquid, and gas. \n\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and shape. Solids maintain their shape and size regardless of the container they are in. Examples include a piece of paper or a grain of sand.\n\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but no definite shape. Liquids take the shape of their container while maintaining a consistent volume. Examples include juice and honey.\n\nWhen matter is a gas, it has neither a definite volume nor shape. Gases expand to fill the space available to them. Many gases are invisible, such as air. Helium is also a gas. It is lighter than air, which is why a helium-filled balloon rises. If helium leaks from a balloon, it expands to fill the surrounding space.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the helium in balloons is a gas. The answer is A.",
    "21135": "A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, they are called opposing forces. When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object. When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.\n\nTo determine if there is a net force on Kimi, look at the forces: Earth's gravity is pulling Kimi down with a force of 600 N. The seat of the cart is pushing Kimi up with a force of 1,200 N. The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi. The answer is A.",
    "21136": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is A.",

    "21146": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked, turning into cookies. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust, which is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating, but rust forming on a metal gate is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument. They can introduce irrelevant information or misrepresent the issues at hand, leading to false conclusions.\n\nIn the given text, the argument is that good students will study the material regardless of whether a test is given, and bad students won't study the material even for a test. This reasoning presents only two choices: good students and bad students. However, it ignores other possible scenarios, such as students who are motivated by the prospect of a test or those who would perform better with guidance and structure provided by a test.\n\nThis illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy, which presents only two choices when more options exist.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "21153": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. \n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth decreases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also decreases.\n\nIn this scenario, Dale was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Dale, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Dale.\n\nThe answer is A.",
