      "question": "<image>\nWhich of the following could Gordon's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",
      "pred": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. To determine what a test can show, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\n\nIn Gordon's case, he was developing a parachute for a spacecraft landing on Mars. He needed to ensure the parachute would land smoothly without swinging wildly, which could damage the spacecraft. Gordon tested a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel simulating a speed of 200 km per hour to observe how much it swung.\n\nFirst, identify what was tested: a parachute with a 1 m vent. Then, identify what the test measured: how much the parachute swung at 200 km per hour.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Compost rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the compost breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change because the apple's matter reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different.

Dolerite has no fixed crystal structure and is not a pure substance, which matches the properties of a rock. The answer is B.",

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The type of matter in the slice of banana changes. The slice of banana turns into a different type of matter. Cooked chicken is a different type of matter than raw chicken. Chicken cooking in an oven is a chemical change. The type of matter in the oven changes. The heat causes the matter to change. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Burning a candle is also a chemical change because the wax in the candle reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Burning is caused by heating, but a piece of pizza rotting is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Wind can wear away soil and rock over time, a process called erosion. This is an example of a physical change. Ice melting is caused by heating, but the ice melts and changes into liquid water, a different state but the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Ice melting is caused by heating, but wind is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Making paper from wood is a chemical change. The type of matter in paper is different from the type of matter in wood. Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.

But they are still made of the same type of matter as before. Cutting your fingernails does not break any chemical bonds. So, no new matter is created. The answer is A.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk become mixed, but they are still made of the same type of matter. Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope is still made of the same type of matter, just in a different shape.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes.

For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Bleaching clothes is a chemical change. The clothes get a different color, and the clothes after bleaching are a different type of matter than before. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple gets a different color, and the apple after browning is a different type of matter than before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. A piece of apple turning brown is caused by heating, but bleaching clothes is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour",

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state. So, it is a physical change.

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Carving a piece of wood is a physical change.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state and thus a physical change. The butter changes state from solid to liquid but remains the same type of matter. An egg being cooked is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change, and the cooked egg is a different type of matter than the raw egg.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down, resulting in less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\n\nIf the amount of matter changes, a larger amount of matter at the same temperature will have more thermal energy than a smaller amount. However, since the two soap bubbles are made of the same material and have the same shape and size, the bubble with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature.\n\nThe answer is B.",

For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Beating an egg is a chemical change where the type of matter in the egg changes; the egg white and egg yolk become different types of matter. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change where the lettuce and dressing remain the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, with different types of matter before and after each change. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The statue's surface slowly reacts with oxygen in the air to form a green patina. The statue's surface is a different type of matter after the change. Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a physical change. The pot's temperature increases, and the clay becomes harder. The pot is made of the same type of matter after the change.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating.

For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air.

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the bread changes. The bread becomes brown and tastes different. Melting glass is a physical change. The glass gets a different shape, but it is still made of glass. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is C.",

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Snails growing shells is a chemical change.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. The sand and gravel remain the same type of matter. Crushing a mineral into powder is also a physical change. The mineral gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes.

A compound-complex sentence has two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.\n\nThe sentence \"The maple leaf, which i Canada's national emblem, has been associated with the country since the 1700s\" consists of an independent clause (\"has been associated with the country since the 1700s\") and a dependent clause (\"The maple leaf, which i Canada's national emblem\"). The dependent clause begins with a subordinating conjunction (\"which i Canada's national emblem\").\n\nTherefore, the sentence is a complex sentence. The answer is C.",

Then answer the question.\n\nAlpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows.\nA shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger. Both animals then retreat to the safety of the burrow.\nFigure: a goby and an alpheid shrimp at the entrance of a burrow.\nOptions: (A) commensal (B) parasitic (C) mutualistic",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. An egg being beaten is a physical change. The egg changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing is caused by cooling, but an egg being beaten is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

      "pred": "Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike. A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other, often using the words \"like\" and \"as.\" For example, \"My sister runs like a cheetah\" compares the sister's running to a cheetah's running using the word \"like,\" implying that the sister runs fast. Another example is \"The new blanket was as soft as a kitten's fur,\" where the blanket's softness is compared to a kitten's fur using the word \"as,\" meaning the blanket is soft in the same way that a kitten's fur is soft.\n\nA metaphor, on the other hand, compares two things by saying that one of them is the other, without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"The snow formed a blanket over the town\" compares the snow to a blanket without using \"like\" or \"as,\" suggesting that the snow covers the town completely.\n\nIn the given sentence, \"The new blanket was as soft as a kitten's fur,\" the blanket's softness is compared to a kitten's fur using the word \"as,\" implying that the blanket is soft in the same way that a kitten's fur is soft.

(B) Both are only physical changes. (C) Both are chemical changes. (D) Both are caused by heating.",
      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change because the tarnish changes into a different type of matter. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: A piece of avocado turning brown is caused by heating, but using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

      "pred": "Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike. A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other, often using the words \"like\" and \"as.\" For example, \"My sister runs like a cheetah\" compares the sister's running to a cheetah's running using the word \"like,\" implying that the sister runs fast. Another example is \"The cat's fur was as dark as the night,\" where the cat's fur and the night are compared using the word \"as,\" meaning the cat's fur is dark.\n\nA metaphor, on the other hand, compares two things by saying that one of them is the other, without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"The snow formed a blanket over the town\" compares snow to a blanket without using \"like\" or \"as,\" suggesting that the snow covers the town completely.\n\nIn the sentence \"Mrs. Leonard is kind, and her heart is gold,\" the comparison of Mrs. Leonard's heart to gold uses the word \"is,\" implying that Mrs. Leonard's heart is actually made of gold.

Choose the most likely ratio.\nContext: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies:\nMost fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.\nOptions: (A) 1:3 (B) 0:4 (C) 3:1 (D) 2:2 (E) 4:0",

For the antennae type trait in fruit flies, the allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a). Therefore, flies with at least one dominant allele (AA or Aa) will have mutated antennae, while only those with two recessive alleles (aa) will have normal antennae.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two heterozygous flies (Aa x Aa). The Punnett square is as follows:\n | A | a\nA | AA | Aa\na | Aa | aa\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype AA, 2 boxes with the genotype Aa, and 1 box with the genotype aa. This results in the following phenotypic ratio:\n- Mutated antennae (AA or Aa): 3 boxes\n- Normal antennae (aa): 1 box\n\nTherefore, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to those with normal antennae is 3:1.

For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric apron gets a new shape. But it is made of the same type of matter as before. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. The lettuce and dressing become mixed together. But they are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.

For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state and is a physical change. The dry ice changes from a solid to a gas, but the gas is made of the same type of matter as the dry ice. Water freezing into ice is also a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from a liquid to a solid, but the ice is made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water freezing is caused by cooling, but dry ice sublimating is not. Both are caused by cooling. Both changes are caused by cooling, but the dry ice sublimation is not.\n\nThe answer is B.",

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a change of state, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a change of state are always the same. A change of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a change of state that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, so the water changes from liquid to gas without forming a different type of matter. Melting glass is a change of state, so the glass changes from a solid to a liquid without forming a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are changes of state. Both changes are changes of state, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are changes of state, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter as the unbroken plate. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk become mixed, but they are still made of the same type of matter as before the mix.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Mixing is caused by heating, but breaking is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals.

For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state and thus a physical change. The wax changes from a solid to a liquid but remains the same type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is also a change of state and a physical change. Water vaporizes and forms clouds, but the water in the clouds is still made of water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Melting wax is caused by heating, but rain is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

      "pred": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. Scientists use different types of bonds to bond multiple chemical elements together. There are two types of bonds: ionic bonds and covalent bonds. In an ionic bond, the chemical elements are bonded together by positive ions and negative ions. The positive ions are made of one chemical element, and the negative ions are made of another chemical element. For example, in the substance table salt, the chemical elements sodium and chlorine are bonded together by ionic bonds. In a covalent bond, the chemical elements are bonded together by sharing electrons. The chemical elements in a covalent bond may be bonded in different ways. For example, in the substance diamond, the chemical elements carbon are bonded together by covalent bonds.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral is broken into pieces, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncrushed mineral.

Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to identify which text uses \"literally\" in its traditional sense, meaning something that is actually the case, rather than a figure of speech. In option (A), \"Jayce's new kitten\u2014barely three weeks old\u2014was literally the size of a softball; it could just about fit in the palm of his hand,\" the word \"literally\" is used to describe an objective fact, not a figure of speech. In option (B), \"Jayce's new kitten\u2014barely three weeks old\u2014was literally just a ball of fluff in the palm of his hand,\" the word \"literally\" is used as a figure of speech to emphasize that the kitten was a ball of fluff.\n\nThe answer is A.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. Boiling sugar to make caramel is also a chemical change because the sugar reacts with water to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, and the types of matter before and after each change are different. Both are caused by heating: Boiling is caused by heating, but a piece of avocado turning brown is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water freezing into ice is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. A paper clip can be bent without breaking, forming a different shape but still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log gets shorter, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncut log. Stretching a rubber band is also a physical change. The rubber band gets longer, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Therefore, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter. Given that 18 inches equals 1.5 meters, 18 yards equals 36 meters, and 18 millimeters equals 1.8 centimeters, we can compare 18 inches and 18 yards to determine which is longer.

Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous cats (Ee x Ee), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | E | e\nE |EE | Ee\ne | Ee | ee\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box withEE, two boxes with Ee, and one box with ee.

There are two ways to get EE in the Punnett square: from two heterozygous cats (EE x EE) or from one heterozygous cat (Ee x Ee). The probability of an offspring being homozygous dominant (EE) is calculated as follows:\nnumber of ways EE can be obtained / total number of outcomes = 2 / 4\n\nThe answer is B.",

If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the given context, the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b). Therefore, offspring with at least one dominant allele (BB or Bb) will have a normal-sized body, while only those with two recessive alleles (bb) will have a dwarf body.\n\nTo determine the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to those with a dwarf body, we use a genetics formula. The formula for the probability of an organism having a particular genotype is:\n\nprobability = (number of ways the genotype can be formed) / (number of ways the genotype can be formed + number of ways the other genotype can be formed)\n\nIn this case, the genotype with two dominant alleles (BB) can be formed in only one way, while the genotype with two recessive alleles (bb) can be formed in two ways.

The steel squares soaked in salt water and vinegar were part of an experimental group, as they were tested under a different condition. The steel squares soaked in salt water were part of a control group, as they were tested under the same condition as the experimental group.\n\nThe answer is B.",

      "pred": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to consider both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown. Plants making food from sunlight, air, and water is a chemical change. The plants make sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a greater distance results in a smaller magnitude of the magnetic force.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

They collect seeds from grasses and prairie sunflowers, and then bury the seeds in the moist layers of sand. Later, the rats come back to eat their buried seeds. The seeds absorb enough moisture from the sand that the kangaroo rats never need to drink water!\nFigure: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in Colorado.\nOptions: (A) the grasses and the prairie sunflowers (B) the Ord's kangaroo rats (C) the grasses, the water, and the sand dunes",

Each of these components interacts with the others in different ways. For example, the kangaroo rats collect seeds from the grasses and prairie sunflowers and bury them in the moist layers of sand. Later, they return to eat the buried seeds, which absorb enough moisture from the sand to sustain the rats without drinking water. \n\nTo solve the problem, we need to identify which option correctly captures the relationships described in the passage.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown. Making jam is a chemical change. The type of matter in the jam is different from the type of matter in the fruit. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change.

      "pred": "Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains, and it can be expressed in various units such as ounces, pounds, or tons. There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton. Given that 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton, we can use some common objects for comparison: a slice of bread weighs about 1 ounce, a can of beans weighs about 1 pound, and a small car weighs about 1 ton. Considering these comparisons, 24 ounces is too light, and 24 tons is too heavy for a cement truck. Therefore, the best estimate for the mass of a cement truck is 24 pounds. The answer is A.",

      "question": "<image>\nWhat is the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings? Choose the most likely ratio.\nContext: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:\nSome scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.\nOptions: (A) 1:3 (B) 4:0 (C) 3:1 (D) 2:2 (E) 0:4",
      "pred": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a particular trait is determined by the combination of alleles in its genotype. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the context of fruit flies, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles: N (dominant) and n (recessive). Offspring receive their alleles from their parents, resulting in genotypes like NN, Nn, or nn.\n\nWithout wings (vestigial wings) is a recessive trait. Therefore, offspring with vestigial wings must have a genotype of nn. Conversely, offspring with normal wings must have a genotype of NN or Nn.\n\nThe Punnett square helps predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two parents. If we assume the parents are heterozygous (Nn), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | N | n\nN | N | N | n\nn | N | n | n | n\n\nIn this scenario, there are three boxes (out of four) with the genotype nn, which represents offspring with vestigial wings. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to those with normal wings is 3:1.\n\nThe answer is C.",

In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, we need to consider both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
