In the given text from Homer's \"The Iliad,\" the phrase \"Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans\" uses repetition to emphasize the theme of anger. Specifically, the phrase \"the anger of Achilles\" is repeated, which helps to establish the central idea of the text. This repetition is an example of chiasmus, a figure of speech where two or more words are repeated in a specific pattern. The answer is A.",
    "5": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. To determine what a test can show, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\n\nIn Gordon's case, he was developing a parachute for a spacecraft landing on Mars. He needed to ensure the parachute would land smoothly without swinging wildly, which could damage the spacecraft. Gordon tested a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel simulating a speed of 200 km per hour to observe how much it swung.\n\nFirst, identify what was tested: a parachute with a 1 m vent. Then, identify what the test measured: how much the parachute swung at 200 km per hour.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Arrows in a food web indicate the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another. To solve this problem, we need to trace the arrows to see which organism's matter was once part of the lichen.\n\nFirst, consider the bilberry. Arrows point from the bilberry to other organisms, so matter from the bilberry was never part of the lichen. Next, consider the mushroom. Arrows point from the mushroom to the earthworm and the bear, and matter from the mushroom was once part of the lichen.\n\nThe answer is B.",

To determine the better estimate for how long it takes to bake lasagna in the oven, we need to consider the cooking time for each layer and the oven's temperature. Given that the oven temperature is around 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C), it typically takes about 10-15 minutes to cook each layer of lasagna. With 3-4 layers, the total cooking time would be around 30-45 minutes. Therefore, the better estimate for how long it takes to bake lasagna in the oven is 30-45 minutes. The answer is A.",

    "29": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Compost rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the compost breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change because the apple's matter reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: A piece of apple turning brown is caused by heating, but compost rotting is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

To determine the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to those with a hairy fleece, we need to consider the genotypes produced by a cross.\n\nA Punnett square helps predict the genotypes of offspring from two parent sheep. If we assume the parents are heterozygous (Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nIn this scenario, there are three boxes (FF, Ff, Ff) representing offspring with a hairy fleece and one box (ff) representing offspring with a woolly fleece. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to those with a hairy fleece is 1:3.\n\nThe answer is D.",

In Farid's case, he wants to investigate which factors affect whether a pie crust will burn in the oven. He has two pie crusts made with white flour, a glass pie pan, an aluminum pie pan, and an oven. \n\nTo decide which question Farid can investigate, we need to match his supplies to the options provided. Option (A) requires additional supplies, such as pie filling for both types of pie and different types of pans. Option (B) requires aluminum foil, which Farid does not have. Option (C) requires a pie crust made with whole wheat flour, which Farid also does not have.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "61": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a greater distance results in a smaller magnitude of the magnetic force.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

The only arrow from the zooplankton leads to the phytoplankton, so matter does not move through the copepod to get to the zooplankton. Next, consider the arrow from the black crappie to the zooplankton. The only arrow from the zooplankton leads to the phytoplankton, so matter does not move through the black crappie to get to the zooplankton. Finally, consider the arrow from the bacteria to the copepod.

    "210": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The dry ice changes from a solid to a gas, but the two are made of the same type of matter: carbon dioxide. Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change, making it black and crispy.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Burning is a chemical change caused by heating.

Several factors can influence overall supply, such as the cost and availability of resources, the number of producers or suppliers, and expected changes in demand. When resources cost less or are easier to obtain, or when there are more producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go up. Conversely, when resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.\n\nIn this case, the number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Norwood decreased from seven to three, meaning there are fewer suppliers of men's shirts. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the overall supply of men's shirts in Norwood probably went down.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "534": "Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms, which are always moving. The energy of these moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down, resulting in less thermal energy and a lower temperature. If the atoms in matter speed up, the temperature goes up, resulting in more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\n\nIf the amount of matter changes, a larger amount of matter at the same temperature will have more thermal energy than a smaller amount.

    "1056": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The type of matter in the slice of banana changes. The slice of banana turns into a different type of matter. Cooked chicken is a different type of matter than raw chicken. Chicken cooking in an oven is a chemical change. The type of matter in the oven changes. The heat causes the matter to change. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. The answer is B.",

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.\n\nLook at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has large teeth and a large mouth, which are adapted to tear through meat. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.\n\nThe tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth, which are adapted to tear through meat.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked, and the cookies are a different type of matter than the cookie dough. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, a physical change.

The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. The answer is A.",
    "1703": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Wind can wear away soil and rock over time, a process called erosion. This is an example of a physical change. Ice melting is caused by heating, but the ice melts and changes into liquid water, a different state but the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Ice melting is caused by heating, but wind is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "1714": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a particular trait is determined by the combination of alleles in its genotype. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the given context, the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b). Therefore, offspring with at least one dominant allele (BB or Bb) will have a normal-sized body, while only those with two recessive alleles (bb) will have a dwarf body.\n\nTo determine the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to those with a dwarf body, we use a genetics formula. The formula for the probability of an organism having a particular genotype is:\n\nprobability = (number of ways the genotype can be formed) / (number of ways the genotype can be formed + number of ways the other genotype can be formed)\n\nIn this case, the genotype with two dominant alleles (BB) can be formed in only one way, while the genotype with two recessive alleles (bb) can be formed in two ways. Therefore, the probability of an offspring having a normal-sized body is 1/3, and the probability of it having a dwarf body is 2/3.\n\nThe answer is A.",

A force is a push or a pull that can make an object start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. When pushing a stroller, the force increases with the weight of the kid in the stroller. Since the kid in the second stroller weighs 26 pounds, which is less than the 27 pounds of the kid in the first stroller, the force required to push the second stroller is less. Therefore, the stroller with the 26-pound kid is pushed with a smaller force. The answer is B.",

When crossing two Syrian hamsters, we can use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of their offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous syrian hamsters (Ff x Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box with FF, two boxes with Ff, and one box with ff. The fur length of the offspring will depend on their genotype. If they have at least one dominant allele (FF or Ff), their fur will be short. If they have only recessive alleles (ff), their fur will be long.\n\nThe probability of an offspring having long fur (ff) is calculated as follows:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 1 / 4\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "2531": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Rust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change. The metal in the frame reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When copper is exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen to form a different type of matter, making the penny dull.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "3385": "Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. Several factors can influence overall supply, such as the cost and availability of resources, the number of producers or suppliers, and expected changes in demand. When resources cost less or are easier to obtain, or when there are more producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go up. Conversely, when resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.\n\nIn this case, the number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Fairview decreased from seven to three, meaning there are fewer suppliers of men's shirts. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the overall supply of men's shirts in Fairview probably went down.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "3504": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state and is a physical change. Liquid water changes to gas, but the water vapor is made of water. Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. Dust is not linked together by chemical bonds.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating, but dust settling is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

He then checked the nails for rust at the same time every day and recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Finally, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar.\n\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. Logan tested the effect of the type of liquid on the rate of rusting. Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. Logan measured the number of days it took each nail to rust.\n\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, Logan's experiment can answer questions about how the type of liquid affects the rate of rusting.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. In this case, the magnets in Pair 1 attract, and the magnets in Pair 2 repel. However, whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force, not its magnitude. Both the sizes of the magnets and the distance between them affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Since the sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2, and the distance between the magnets is also the same, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

    "3567": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a particular trait is determined by the combination of alleles in its genotype. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the given context, the allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f). Therefore, offspring with black fur will outnumber those with brown fur.\n\nTo determine the expected ratio, we need to consider the genotypes represented in the Punnett square. In a cross between two heterozygous rabbits (Ff x Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nThere are three boxes (FF, Ff, Ff) representing offspring with black fur and only one box (ff) representing offspring with brown fur.

    "3576": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. So, the total mass before water evaporates from a lake is equal to the total mass after the water evaporates. Stretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer, but it is still made of the same type of matter. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. So, the total mass before stretching a rubber band is equal to the total mass after the stretching. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating. But stretching a rubber band is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is D.",

Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, you need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, you can find the number of green particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter, so their concentrations are the same. The answer is C.",

    "3844": "Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike. A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other, often using the words \"like\" and \"as.\" For example, \"My sister runs like a cheetah\" compares the sister's running to a cheetah's running using the word \"like,\" implying that the sister runs fast. Another example is \"The cat's fur was as dark as the night,\" where the cat's fur and the night are compared using the word \"as,\" meaning the cat's fur is dark.\n\nA metaphor, on the other hand, compares two things by saying that one of them is the other, without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"The snow formed a blanket over the town\" compares snow to a blanket without using \"like\" or \"as,\" suggesting that the snow covers the town completely.\n\nIn the given sentence, \"Mrs. Robertson is an owl, working at night and sleeping during the day,\" Mrs. Robertson is compared to an owl. An owl works at night and sleeps during the day, so the comparison is made using a simile. The answer is B.",

    "3973": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. Cutting your fingernails is a physical change. Your fingernails are shorter after you cut them. But they are still made of the same type of matter as before. Cutting your fingernails does not break any chemical bonds. So, no new matter is created. The answer is A.",

    "4603": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk become mixed, but they are still made of the same type of matter. Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope is still made of the same type of matter, just in a different shape.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "4933": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

    "5475": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Stapling an envelope shut is also a physical change. The envelope gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Its fur also helps it blend in with the snow, making it difficult for predators to spot it.\n\nTo determine which animal shares a similar adaptation, we need to look at the characteristics of each option. The polar bear has thick fur and a white coat, which are adaptations for survival in cold, snowy environments. On the other hand, the porcupine has sharp quills, which are not suited for blending in with snow.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "6020": "A food web is a model that shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models simplify complex natural processes by representing how matter moves between organisms. Arrows in a food web indicate the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another. To solve this problem, we need to trace the arrows to see which organism's matter was once part of the lichen.\n\nFirst, consider the bear sedge. Arrows point from the bear sedge to the grizzly bear, so matter from the bear sedge does not reach the grizzly bear. Next, consider the grizzly bear. Arrows point from the grizzly bear to the mushroom, so matter from the grizzly bear does reach the mushroom. Arrows point from the mushroom to the lichen, so matter from the mushroom does reach the lichen. Arrows point from the lichen to the earthworm, so matter from the lichen does not reach the earthworm. Arrows point from the earthworm to the mushroom, so matter from the earthworm does reach the mushroom. Arrows point from the mushroom to the lichen, so matter from the earthworm does reach the lichen. Arrows point from the lichen to the collembola, so matter from the lichen does not reach the collembola. Arrows point from the collembola to the soil, so matter from the collembola does reach the soil.\n\nThe answer is A.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules.

Conversely, if the forces have different magnitudes, they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force on the object.\n\nTo determine if there is a net force on Valeria, we examine the forces: Earth's gravity is pulling Valeria down with a force of 600 N, and the seat of the cart is pushing Valeria up with a force of 1,200 N. Since these forces are in opposite directions and have different magnitudes (600 N and 1,200 N), they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force on Valeria.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "6608": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a greater distance results in a smaller magnitude of the magnetic force.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is B.",

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state and thus a physical change. The butter changes state from solid to liquid but remains the same type of matter. An egg being cooked is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change, and the cooked egg is a different type of matter than the raw egg.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.

    "8515": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The statue's surface slowly reacts with oxygen in the air to form a green patina. The statue's surface is a different type of matter after the change. Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a physical change. The pot's temperature increases, and the clay becomes harder. The pot is made of the same type of matter after the change.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating.

The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

    "8732": "Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship. People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another. It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way. Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous! The answer is B.",

    "8749": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.\n\n* Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. But clearer water is still made of the same type of matter as the muddy water.\n* Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Dry ice is made of the same type of matter as the gas that is formed when it sublimates.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\n\n* Both are only physical changes.\n* Both are chemical changes.\n* Both are changes of state.\n* Both are caused by heating.\n* Both are caused by cooling.\n\nStep 3: Solve the problem.\n\nChemical changes and changes of state are different ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the types of molecules in matter before and after the change are always different. In a change of state, the types of molecules in matter before and after the change are always the same. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. But clearer water is still made of the same type of matter as the muddy water. Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state.

Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are changes of state. Both changes are changes of state. No new matter is created. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Dry ice sublimating is caused by cooling.

Here are some ways in which terrestrial ecosystems can differ from each other: the pattern of weather (climate), or the type of soil. Soil is made up of matter that has broken down over time, and it can differ in nutrients, or the types of nutrients it contains. Nutrients are chemical elements that plants need to grow. Most plants need a relatively small number of nutrients, and they need them in a specific order. Soil that is poor in nutrients does not have enough of the nutrients that plants need, while soil that is rich in nutrients has more nutrients than plants need. Most plants have small roots, and they cannot reach deep into soil to get nutrients. So, soil that is mostly small plants has soil that is poor in nutrients. The answer is A.",

    "9058": "A planet's volume indicates its size. In our solar system, planets are primarily composed of rock, gas, or ice. The volume of a planet is often expressed in scientific notation due to its large magnitude. For instance, Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3. To compare volumes, we first look at the exponents in scientific notation. If the exponents are equal, we then compare the coefficients.\n\nTo determine if Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times that of Mars, we calculate 10,000 times the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.62 x 10^12 km^3. Multiplying this by 10,000 gives us 1.62 x 10^14 km^3. Since 1.43 x 10^15 km^3 (Jupiter's volume) is greater than 1.62 x 10^14 km^3, Jupiter's volume is indeed more than 10,000 times that of Mars.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "9104": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes; the crust becomes brown and the apples become soft. A silver spoon that has been tarnished has a different appearance, but when polished, it returns to its original appearance. Both changes are chemical changes.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes.

    "9295": "A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction. In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances. The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change. The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction. So, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products.\n\nWhen hydrogen peroxide breaks down, it breaks down into water and oxygen gas. So, in this chemical reaction, hydrogen peroxide is a reactant. Water is a product. The answer is A.",

    "9323": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to identify which text uses \"travesty\" in its traditional sense, meaning a ridiculous imitation or a parody. In option (A), \"In 1687, John Phillips published a controversial English translation of Cervantes's Don Quixote. Phillips's translation, a travesty of the original story, was filled with vulgar humor,\" the word \"travesty\" is used to describe a ridiculous imitation of the original story, which aligns with its traditional sense. In option (B), \"John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost was first published in 1667. It's a travesty that only thirty-three pages of the original manuscript have survived,\" the word \"travesty\" is used to mean a disappointment or a tragedy, which is a nontraditional sense.\n\nThe answer is A.",

When two forces act on an object in opposite directions and have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object. Conversely, if the forces have different magnitudes, they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force on the object.\n\nTo determine if there is a net force on Natalie, we examine the forces: Earth's gravity is pulling Natalie down with a force of 600 N, and the seat of the cart is pushing her up with a force of 1,200 N. Since these forces are in opposite directions and have different magnitudes (600 N and 1,200 N), they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force on Natalie.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "9394": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. Mixing sand and water is a physical change. The sand and water become mixed, but the mixture is still made of the same type of matter as the sand and water before the change.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing is caused by cooling, but mixing sand and water is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "9546": "In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent through the process of diffusion, moving from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. This movement continues until equilibrium is reached, where the concentration of solute particles is equal on both sides of the membrane. The membrane is permeable, allowing solute particles to pass through freely.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the direction in which more solute particles moved to reach equilibrium. Initially, there were 8 solute particles on the left side and 4 on the right side. At equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on each side, indicating that more particles moved to the right side.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "9548": "Thermal energy is the energy that comes from the motion of particles within matter. Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold an object is, and it correlates with the thermal energy of the object. When the temperature of an object decreases, the motion of its particles slows down, resulting in less thermal energy. Given that both potatoes have the same mass but different temperatures, the potato at 40\u00b0C has less thermal energy compared to the potato at 60\u00b0C. The answer is B.",

The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. For instance, brightly colored skin can serve as a warning sign to predators. The blue poison dart frog has poisonous glands in its brightly colored skin, which serves as a warning sign to predators that it is poisonous.\n\nTo determine which animal has a similar adaptation, we need to look at the skin adaptations of each option. The sharpnose-puffer has sharp spines in its skin, which serve as a defense against predators. In contrast, the gray tree frog has reddish-brown skin that does not serve as a warning sign to ward off predators. \n\nThe answer is A.",
    "9620": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and water is a physical change. The sand and water remain separate, and no new matter is created. Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood gets a different shape, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncarved wood.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "9891": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of \"ironic\" is when something happens that is contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. In the second text, Levi tried to escape the snow by going to Florida, but he encountered a rare snowstorm there, which is ironic in the traditional sense.

    "10103": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the bread changes. The bread becomes brown and tastes different. Melting glass is a physical change. The glass gets a different shape, but it is still made of glass. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is C.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Snails growing shells is a chemical change. The snail's body makes a different type of matter than before. The matter makes up the shell. Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using energy from sunlight. The sugar is a different type of matter than before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the given context, the allele for red fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for yellow fruit (f). To determine the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to those with red fruit, we need to consider the genotypes represented in the Punnett square.\n\nA Punnett square shows the possible genotypes of offspring from a cross between two parents. In this case, we need to count the number of boxes representing each genotype. Offspring with yellow fruit must have at least one recessive allele (f), while offspring with red fruit must have the dominant allele (F).\n\nBased on the Punnett square provided, all 4 boxes have the dominant allele (F), indicating that all offspring will have red fruit. There are no boxes with the recessive allele (f), so no offspring will have yellow fruit.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "10623": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. An egg being beaten is a physical change. The egg changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing is caused by cooling, but an egg being beaten is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "11006": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change because the tarnish changes into a different type of matter. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric apron gets a new shape. But it is made of the same type of matter as before. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. The lettuce and dressing become mixed together. But they are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.

To determine the order, compare the first letters of the words. If they are the same, compare the second letters, and so on. If one word is shorter and there are no more letters to compare, the shorter word comes first. For example, \"be\" comes before \"bed.\"\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to check if \"hind\" falls alphabetically between \"heart\" and \"hood.\" Since \"hind\" comes after \"heart\" and before \"hood,\" it would be found on that page.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "12072": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to consider both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter, so their concentrations are the same.

    "12123": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water changes to water vapor. Water vapor is made of water. So, water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating. But rain forming is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is C.",

    "12399": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change, and the egg becomes different matter than it was before. Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter, causing it to dull.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Cooking is caused by heating, but a penny tarnishing is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Getting a haircut is a physical change. Your hair is shorter after a haircut, but the hair is still made of the same type of matter as before. Sawing a log in half is also a physical change.

Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to identify which text uses \"unique\" in its traditional sense, meaning one-of-a-kind. In option (A), \"Warren custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Oak Grove,\" the word \"unique\" is used to describe a table that is one-of-a-kind, made specifically for Warren. In option (B), \"Warren bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Oak Grove,\" the word \"unique\" is used to describe a table that is unusual or different, but not necessarily one-of-a-kind.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "13525": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Loose matter before and after a physical change is always the same type of matter. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

Another example is \"The cat's fur was as dark as the night,\" where the cat's fur and the night are compared using the word \"as,\" meaning the cat's fur is dark.\n\nA metaphor, on the other hand, compares two things by saying that one of them is the other, without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"The snow formed a blanket over the town\" compares snow to a blanket without using \"like\" or \"as,\" suggesting that the snow covers the town completely.\n\nUsing similes and metaphors in writing can create vivid imagery for the reader. In this case, the sentence \"The bare tree's branches were sharp needles\" uses a simile because it compares the branches to sharp needles using the word \"sharp.\" The sentence \"The bare tree's branches were as sharp as needles\" uses a metaphor because it compares the branches to needles without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "14324": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter as the unbroken plate. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk become mixed, but they are still made of the same type of matter as before the mix.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Mixing is caused by heating, but breaking is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

The dromedary camel uses its feet to walk and run, not to grab prey. The answer is A.",
    "14941": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

    "15874": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state and thus a physical change. The wax changes from a solid to a liquid but remains the same type of matter. Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn is transformed into a different shape, but the type of matter in the scarf is the same as in the yarn.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "15900": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the unbroken plate. Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The water vapor changes from a gas to a liquid, but the water is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water vaporizing is caused by heating, but breaking a plate is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

When crossing two Labrador retrievers, we can use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of their offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous Labrador retrievers (Ff x Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box with FF, two boxes with Ff, and one box with ff. The fur color of the offspring will depend on their genotype. If they have at least one dominant allele (F), their fur will be black. If they have only recessive alleles (f), their fur will be brown.\n\nThe probability of an offspring having brown fur (ff) is calculated as follows:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 1 / 4\n\nThe answer is E.",

The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.\n\nTurkey vultures have a sharp hooked beak, which is adapted to tear through meat. They use their beaks to cut the meat into pieces they can swallow. Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.\n\nThe bateleur has a sharp hooked beak, which is adapted to tear through meat. The roseate spoonbill has a long spoon-shaped beak, which is not adapted to tear through meat. The roseate spoonbill uses its beak to filter through mud for invertebrates and small fish.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "16659": "Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism and affect its observable traits. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff. The phenotype is the observable trait, such as purple or white flowers, depending on the genotype.\n\nIn the case of the fruit fly, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles: A for mutated antennae and a for normal antennae. The fly in question has one allele for mutated antennae (A) and one allele for normal antennae (a). Therefore, its genotype is AA. The observable trait, or phenotype, for this fly is mutated antennae.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "16678": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change because the penny's surface changes into a different type of matter. A dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years is also a chemical change because the bone's matter gets replaced by rock matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "16939": "In genetics, an organism's observable traits, or phenotype, are determined by its genotype, which is the combination of alleles it possesses for a specific gene. Alleles can be dominant or recessive. A dominant allele will mask the presence of a recessive allele in the phenotype. \n\nIn the context of dachshund dogs, the gene for fur texture has two alleles: F (rough fur) and f (soft fur). The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). \n\nChance has a heterozygous genotype, Ff, meaning it has one dominant allele (F) and one recessive allele (f). Since the dominant allele (F) will mask the presence of the recessive allele (f), Chance's phenotype will be determined by the dominant allele.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "17233": "Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms, which are always moving. The energy of these moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down, resulting in less thermal energy and a lower temperature. If the atoms in matter speed up, the temperature goes up, resulting in more thermal energy and a higher temperature. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass remains the same. Since the amount of matter in each pot is the same, the pot of spaghetti sauce with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature. The answer is B.",

    "17611": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state and thus a physical change. The wax changes from a solid to a liquid but remains the same type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is also a change of state and a physical change. Water vaporizes and forms clouds, but the water in the clouds is still made of water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Melting wax is caused by heating, but rain is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "17688": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called a granular material. Snowflakes are a type of granular material.

    "17797": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. Scientists use different types of bonds to bond multiple chemical elements together. There are two types of bonds: ionic bonds and covalent bonds. In an ionic bond, the chemical elements are bonded together by positive ions and negative ions. The positive ions are made of one chemical element, and the negative ions are made of another chemical element. For example, in the substance table salt, the chemical elements sodium and chlorine are bonded together by ionic bonds. In a covalent bond, the chemical elements are bonded together by sharing electrons. The chemical elements in a covalent bond may be bonded in different ways. For example, in the substance diamond, the chemical elements carbon are bonded together by covalent bonds. It is a good idea to remember that sodium chloride is composed of two chemical elements: sodium and chlorine. These chemical elements are bonded together by ionic bonds. The answer is B.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Loosening an egg's shell is a physical change. The egg's matter is still matter that came from an egg. Beat an egg, and you get egg matter that is different from the matter that was in the unbeaten egg. But, beaten egg matter is still made of the same type of matter as the unbeaten egg. An egg is a chemical change. Cracking an egg's shell is a chemical change. The egg's matter touches the shell, and the matter changes. The matter touches the shell, and the matter changes into a different type of matter. For example, the shell touches the egg's matter, and the egg's matter changes into egg white and egg yolk. An unbeaten egg is a different type of matter than a beaten egg. But, beaten egg matter is still made of the same type of matter as the unbeaten egg. The answer is B.",

The giant pangolin has hard scales covering much of its skin, which makes it difficult for predators to hurt or kill it.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to identify which animal has a similar adaptation. The nine-banded armadillo has sharp scales covering much of its skin, which are an adaptation for protection against predators with sharp teeth. In contrast, Grant's gazelle has thick fur covering much of its skin, which is not an adaptation for defense against predators with sharp teeth.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "18722": "An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large neck with strong muscles might help an animal lift heavy objects, while a long neck might help an animal reach high branches. The giraffe has a long neck adapted for reaching high branches. It can eat leaves that other animals cannot reach. Now, let's look at each animal to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The black-tailed jackrabbit has a short neck and uses its legs to reach high branches, so it does not have a neck adapted for reaching high branches. The gerenuk has a long neck adapted for reaching high branches, like the giraffe. Its neck is an adaptation for survival. The answer is B.",

    "18892": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

    "19143": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. Boiling sugar to make caramel is also a chemical change because the sugar reacts with water to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, and the types of matter before and after each change are different. Both are caused by heating: Boiling is caused by heating, but a piece of avocado turning brown is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "19818": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown. Making jam is a chemical change. The type of matter in the jam is different from the type of matter in the fruit. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. Making jam is a chemical change. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But making jam is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water freezing into ice is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. A paper clip can be bent without breaking, forming a different shape but still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water freezing is caused by cooling, not heating. Both are caused by cooling. Both changes are caused by cooling, but not the same way.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Alleles can be dominant or recessive. A dominant allele will mask the presence of a recessive allele in the phenotype. Recessive alleles will only show their trait if no dominant allele is present.\n\nIn the context of rock pocket mice, the gene for fur color has two alleles: F (dark fur) and f (light fur). The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). Boba has a homozygous genotype ff, meaning Boba has two recessive alleles.\n\nSince the f allele is recessive and there are no dominant F alleles present, Boba's phenotype will be the trait associated with the recessive allele.

    "20788": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a particular trait is determined by the combination of alleles in its genotype. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the context of fruit flies, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles: N (dominant) and n (recessive). Offspring receive their alleles from their parents, resulting in genotypes like NN, Nn, or nn.\n\nWithout wings (vestigial wings) is a recessive trait. Therefore, offspring with vestigial wings must have a genotype of nn. Conversely, offspring with normal wings must have a genotype of NN or Nn.\n\nThe Punnett square helps predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two parents. If we assume the parents are heterozygous (Nn), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | N | n\nN | N | N | n\nn | N | n | n | n\n\nIn this scenario, there are three boxes (out of four) with the genotype nn, which represents offspring with vestigial wings. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to those with normal wings is 3:1.\n\nThe answer is C.",

In Ryan's case, he wants to investigate which factors affect which foods squirrels choose to collect. He has two identical squirrel feeders, a bag of sunflower seeds, a bag of walnuts, and a tree to hang the feeders from. \n\nTo decide which question Ryan can investigate, we need to match his supplies to the options provided. Option (A) requires identifying which type of tree the squirrels feed from most often, which Ryan does not have supplies for. Option (B) requires comparing sunflower seeds and walnuts, which Ryan can do with his available supplies. Option (C) requires testing walnuts in large feeders versus small feeders, which Ryan can also do with his available supplies.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Inherited traits are passed down through families and do not need to be learned, while acquired traits are gained during a person's life through learning or environmental factors. In this context, knowing how to fly a kite is an acquired trait. The process of solving the problem involves identifying which option indicates that Peter learned this skill. The answer is B.",
    "20997": "Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism and affect its observable traits. These genes can have different alleles that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff. The phenotype is the observable trait, such as purple or white flowers.\n\nIn the context of sheep, the gene for wool color has two alleles: L for white wool and l for black wool. Bingo has black wool and two alleles for black wool, indicating a genotype of ll. Therefore, Bingo's observable trait, or phenotype, for the wool color trait is black wool.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "20998": "Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. To identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\n\nIn Sasha's experiment, she cut tomato and broccoli plant leaves into one-inch squares, placed six leaf squares in each container, added one slug from her garden to each container, and measured the amount of each leaf square that had been eaten by the slugs after two days.\n\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. Sasha tested the effect of different types of leaves on slug eating behavior. Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. Sasha measured the amount of each leaf square that had been eaten by the slugs.\n\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, Sasha's experiment can answer questions about how the type of leaves affects how much leaves the slugs eat.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "21000": "When writing, it's important to avoid vague pronoun references, which occur when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent. For example, in the sentence \"When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief,\" the pronoun \"she\" could refer to either Lisa or Kim, making the sentence unclear. Vague pronoun references can be corrected by replacing the pronoun with its correct antecedent or rewriting the sentence.\n\nIn the given options, the first sentence is: \"Dave went on to calculus after studying trigonometry, but he never fully comprehended calculus.\" This sentence has a vague pronoun reference because \"he\" could refer to either Dave or trigonometry, making it unclear who never fully comprehended calculus. The second sentence is: \"Dave went on to calculus after studying trigonometry, but he never fully comprehended it.\" This sentence corrects the vague pronoun reference by replacing \"he\" with \"it,\" making the sentence clear.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "21009": "Volume is a measure of how much space something occupies. In the metric system, volume can be measured in units such as milliliters (mL) and liters (L). There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter, so 1 milliliter is much smaller than 1 liter. Given that a large soda bottle typically holds around 2 liters and a raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, it is clear that 12 liters is far too large for a soda bottle cap. Therefore, the better estimate for the volume of a soda bottle cap is 12 milliliters. The answer is B.",

    "21135": "A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object, and every force has a direction and a magnitude. When two forces act on an object in opposite directions and have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object. Conversely, if the forces have different magnitudes, they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force on the object.\n\nTo determine if there is a net force on Kimi, we examine the forces: Earth's gravity is pulling Kimi down with a force of 600 N, and the seat of the cart is pushing Kimi up with a force of 1,200 N. Since these forces are in opposite directions and have different magnitudes (600 N and 1,200 N), they are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "21136": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. The answer is A.",

The answer is A.",
    "21146": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked, and the cookies are a different type of matter than the cookie dough. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. When air touches the gate, the surface of the gate changes into a different type of matter, forming rust.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy will change accordingly. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. In this scenario, as the water balloon fell toward Dale, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Dale. The answer is A.",
    "21159": "A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate. An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence, while a dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence. \n\nA simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause. A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or,\" or \"so.\" A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause, usually beginning with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.\n\nAnalyzing the given sentence: \"Joel took several incredible panoramic photographs of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain.\" This sentence contains one independent clause (\"Joel took several incredible panoramic photographs\") and one dependent clause (\"of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain\").
