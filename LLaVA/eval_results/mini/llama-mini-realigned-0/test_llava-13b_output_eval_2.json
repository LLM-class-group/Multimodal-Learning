      "question": "<image>\nWhich of the following could Gordon's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",
      "pred": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. To determine what a test can show, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\n\nIn Gordon's case, he was developing a parachute for a spacecraft landing on Mars. He needed to ensure the parachute would land smoothly without swinging wildly, which could damage the spacecraft. Gordon tested a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel simulating a speed of 200 km per hour to observe how much it swung.\n\nFirst, identify what was tested: a parachute with a 1 m vent. Then, identify what the test measured: how much the parachute swung at 200 km per hour.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.\nOptions: (A) bilberry (B) mushroom",
      "pred": "A food web is a model that shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food, simplifying complex interactions. Arrows in a food web indicate the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another. To solve this problem, we need to identify which organism has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web.\n\nLichens are a symbiotic organism that consist of a fungus and a photosynthetic organism, typically a green algae or a cyanobacterium. The fungus and photosynthetic organism live together in a tight relationship, with the fungus providing the photosynthetic organism with protection and nutrients, and the photosynthetic organism producing food from light energy.\n\nWhen a lichen is eaten, the matter that was once part of the lichen moves through the ecosystem, as indicated by an arrow in the food web. To solve the problem, we need to identify which organism has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web.\n\nA mushroom has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web, indicating that matter that was once part of the lichen moves to the mushroom when it is eaten. On the other hand, a bilberry does not have an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web, indicating that matter that was once part of the lichen does not move to the bilberry when it is eaten.\n\nThe answer is B.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Dry ice sublimating is a change of state and thus a physical change. The dry ice changes from a solid to a gas without forming a liquid. A marshmallow burning is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change, making it black and crispy.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, with the marshmallow changing into different types of matter. Both are caused by heating: Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

      "pred": "To determine which backpack is pulled with a larger force, we need to consider the relationship between force and weight. A force is a push or a pull that can make an object start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. When rolling a backpack, a force is required to keep it moving at a constant speed. The force increases as the backpack's weight increases, due to the greater resistance to motion.\n\nTherefore, a backpack carrying 9 pounds requires a larger force to maintain a constant speed than a backpack carrying 6 pounds.

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.\n\nLook at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has large teeth and a large mouth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The cougar uses its mouth to cut up meat into pieces it can swallow.\n\nNow look at each animal.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating; ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Ice melting in a cup is a change of state and is a physical change. The ice melts and changes from a solid to a liquid, but the melted ice and the original ice are made of the same type of matter: water.

Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state and is a physical change. Liquid water changes into gas without forming a different type of matter. Dust settling out of the air is a change of state and is a physical change.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCarter was installing solar panels on the roof of a client's house. The panels had to provide enough electricity to power the house year-round. Carter needed to decide how many panels to install and which side of the roof to install them on. If he put the panels on the side that got the most sun, then he could use fewer panels, and the client would save money. Carter installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof. Then, he measured the amount of sunlight the sensors on each side of the roof recorded over one sunny summer day.\nFigure: installing solar panels on a roof.\nOptions: (A) the amount of sunlight the roof would get throughout the year (B) how many solar panels could fit on each side of the roof (C) which side of the roof got more sun over one day",

Therefore, arrows in the food web that lead to phytoplankton have no other arrows pointing to them, indicating that matter does not pass through any other organisms before reaching phytoplankton.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n- An orca has only one arrow pointing to it, so matter does not pass through the orca.\n- A sea cucumber has numerous arrows pointing to it, so matter does pass through the sea cucumber.\n- A sea urchin has only one arrow pointing to it, so matter does not pass through the sea urchin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",

In the sentence \"Emily and Scott will spend the afternoon at the beach,\" the verb \"will spend\" indicates an action that is going to happen, which is characteristic of the future tense.

The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change where the type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked, becoming cookies! A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change where the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter. Sewing an apron is also a physical change. The apron gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is D.",

Several factors can influence overall supply, such as changes in resource costs, the number of producers or suppliers, and expected changes in demand. When resources cost less or are easier to obtain, or when there are more producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go up. Conversely, when resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.\n\nIn this case, the number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Wildgrove decreased from seven to three, meaning there are fewer suppliers of men's shirts.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.

For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating; ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nPamela and Kimi were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nOptions: (A) if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry (B) if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",
      "pred": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. To determine what a test can show, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\n\nIn Mason's case, he was developing a parachute for a spacecraft landing on Mars. He needed to ensure the parachute would land smoothly without swinging wildly, which could damage the spacecraft. Mason tested a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel simulating a speed of 200 km per hour to observe how much it swung.\n\nFirst, identify what was tested: a parachute with a 1 m vent. Then, identify what the test measured: how much the parachute swung at 200 km per hour.\n\nThe answer is A.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change; the two remain separate and are not transformed into a different type of matter. Crushing a mineral into powder is also a physical change; the mineral is broken into smaller pieces, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncrushed mineral.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Crushing is caused by heating, but mixing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows.\nA shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating; ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. An egg being beaten is a physical change. The egg changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing is caused by cooling, but an egg being beaten is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae.

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric gets a different shape, but it is made of the same type of matter. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. The lettuce and the dressing become mixed, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

She removed the egg and dried it. She repeated the process with the other five glasses, recording each time if the egg floated. Tanvi repeated this test with two more eggs and counted the number of times the eggs floated in fresh water compared to salty water.\nFigure: an egg floating in a glass of salty water.\nOptions: (A) Are eggs more likely to float in fresh water or salty water? (B) Does the amount of water in a glass affect whether eggs sink or float in the water?",

In Tanvi's experiment, she tested eggs in fresh water and salty water to see if they would float. She measured the outcome by counting the number of times the eggs floated in each type of water.\n\nTo identify the question that Tanvi's experiment can best answer, we need to focus on what was tested (the type of water) and what was measured (the number of times the eggs floated). This experiment was designed to compare the floating behavior of eggs in fresh water versus salty water.\n\nThe answer is A.",

For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a change caused by heating or cooling, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a change caused by heating or cooling are always the same. For example, ice melting is a change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, so the water changes from liquid to gas without forming a different type of matter. Melting glass is a change of state, so the glass changes from a solid to a liquid without forming a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are chemical changes. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, not a chemical change. Melting glass is a change of state, not a chemical change. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Getting a haircut is a physical change because your hair is shorter after a haircut but still made of the same type of matter. Sawing a log in half is also a physical change because the two pieces of the log are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change; the plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter as the unbroken plate. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change; the two are mixed together, but both are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Mixing is caused by heating, but breaking is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

      "pred": "An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim, and feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground. Look at the picture of the white-tailed eagle. The white-tailed eagle has long toes with sharp claws, which are adapted for grabbing prey. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The brahminy kite has long toes with sharp claws, which are adapted for grabbing prey. The dromedary camel has long toes with thick fur, which are not adapted for grabbing prey. The dromedary camel uses its feet to walk and run, not to grab prey. The answer is A.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change where the sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change where the different parts mix together but remain the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the unbroken plate. Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The water vapor and the condensed water are made of the same type of matter as before the change.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water vaporizing is caused by heating, but breaking a plate is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change where the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. A dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years is also a chemical change, where the bone's matter gets replaced by rock matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Neither change is caused by heating.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change where the heat causes the matter in the chicken to change, making it crispy. Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change where the heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change, making it black and crispy.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change where the different parts mix together but remain the same type of matter. Breaking a piece of glass is a physical change as well, the glass gets broken into pieces but remains the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nManny was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Manny put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

When resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.

      "pred": "In an experiment, variables are parts that change. To determine how one variable affects another, you can design an experiment.

You would do the same for a second group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer. By comparing the results, you can conclude that fertilizer affects pea plant height.\n\nIn Kenneth's experiment, he investigated whether the temperature of the heating pad affects how quickly cucumber seeds germinate. He grew one group of seeds in soil heated to 75\u00b0F and measured the number of days it took for the seeds to germinate. He grew another group of seeds in soil heated to 85\u00b0F and measured the number of days it took for the seeds to germinate.

If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the context of the tomato plant's fruit texture, the allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f). Therefore, organisms with at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture trait will have smooth fruit.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two heterozygous plants (Ff x Ff). The Punnett square is as follows:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype FF, 2 boxes with the genotype Ff, and 1 box with the genotype ff. This results in the following phenotypic ratio:\n- Box FF: Smooth fruit\n- Box Ff: Smooth fruit\n- Box ff: Fuzzy fruit\n\nTherefore, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to those with fuzzy fruit is 3:1.

When a rat eats an insect that has a tapeworm inside it, the insect is digested, but the tapeworm remains alive.\nThe tapeworm is moved into the rat's intestines and uses suckers to attach itself to the intestine wall. Inside the rat's intestine, the tapeworm absorbs nutrients from food that the rat has eaten. If the rat has many tapeworms in its intestines, it will become weak from lack of nutrients.\nFigure: a tapeworm attached to the wall of an intestine.\nOptions: (A) parasitic (B) mutualistic (C) commensal",

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches a penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull. An old sandwich rotting is a chemical change.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The crust turns brown, and the filling becomes soft and sweet. Plants making food from sunlight, air, and water is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But plants are not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the context of the pea plant's pod color trait, the allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D).

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. The matter in the egg before cooking and after cooking is different.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes.

In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

Therefore, the Punnett square for a cross between two rats would look like this:\n | E | e\nE |EE | Ee\ne | Ee | ee\n\nThere are three boxes (EE, Ee, Ee) representing offspring with normal ears and one box (ee) representing offspring with dumbo ears. This indicates that the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to those with normal ears is 1:3.\n\nThe answer is E.",

For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air.

So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water changes to gas without forming a different type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is also a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vaporizes and builds up in the cloud. But, it is not a different type of matter. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is formed. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water vaporizing is caused by heating.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling, such as water vaporizing, which is a physical change that can be caused by heating.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that mass is conserved in both physical and chemical changes, meaning the total mass remains the same before and after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state and thus a physical change. The wax changes from a solid to a liquid but remains the same type of matter. Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn is transformed into a different shape but remains the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral is broken into pieces, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncrushed mineral. Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state, a physical change. The dry ice changes from a solid to a gas, but the gas is made of the same type of matter as the solid dry ice.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Dry ice sublimating is caused by cooling, not heating. Crushing a mineral into powder is not caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Loosening an egg's shell is a physical change. The matter inside the egg before and after a physical change is always the same type of matter. An egg is a chemical change. The matter inside an egg is different before and after a chemical change.

The volume of a planet is often expressed in scientific notation due to its large magnitude. For instance, Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3. To compare volumes, we first look at the exponents in scientific notation. If the exponents are equal, we then compare the coefficients.\n\nTo determine if Jupiter's volume is more than 1,000 times that of Earth, we calculate 1,000 times the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 2.2 x 10^14 km^3. Multiplying this by 1,000 gives us 2.2 x 10^18 km^3. Since 1.43 x 10^15 km^3 (Jupiter's volume) is less than 2.2 x 10^18 km^3, Jupiter's volume is not more than 1,000 times that of Earth.\n\nThe answer is A.",

For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules.

For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.\nOptions: (A) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (B) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (C) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",
      "pred": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn this case, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is A.",

      "pred": "A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate. An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence, while a dependent clause is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone. A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause. A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction. A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause, usually beginning with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.\n\nThe sentence \"Joel took several incredible panoramic photographs of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain\" is a complex sentence. It consists of an independent clause \"Joel took several incredible panoramic photographs\" and a dependent clause \"of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain.\"\n\nThe answer is C.",
