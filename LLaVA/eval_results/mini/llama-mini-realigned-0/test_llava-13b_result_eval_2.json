    "5": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. To determine what a test can show, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\n\nIn Gordon's case, he was developing a parachute for a spacecraft landing on Mars. He needed to ensure the parachute would land smoothly without swinging wildly, which could damage the spacecraft. Gordon tested a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel simulating a speed of 200 km per hour to observe how much it swung.\n\nFirst, identify what was tested: a parachute with a 1 m vent. Then, identify what the test measured: how much the parachute swung at 200 km per hour.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "23": "A food web is a model that shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food, simplifying complex interactions. Arrows in a food web indicate the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another. To solve this problem, we need to identify which organism has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web.\n\nLichens are a symbiotic organism that consist of a fungus and a photosynthetic organism, typically a green algae or a cyanobacterium. The fungus and photosynthetic organism live together in a tight relationship, with the fungus providing the photosynthetic organism with protection and nutrients, and the photosynthetic organism producing food from light energy.\n\nWhen a lichen is eaten, the matter that was once part of the lichen moves through the ecosystem, as indicated by an arrow in the food web. To solve the problem, we need to identify which organism has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web.\n\nA mushroom has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web, indicating that matter that was once part of the lichen moves to the mushroom when it is eaten. On the other hand, a bilberry does not have an arrow pointing to it from the lichen in the food web, indicating that matter that was once part of the lichen does not move to the bilberry when it is eaten.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "29": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Compost rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the compost breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The type of matter in the apple changes. The apple turns from white to brown.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Compost rotting is caused by heating. But a piece of apple turning brown is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",
    "42": "In genetics, the phenotype of a trait is determined by the combination of alleles in the genotype. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the context of sheep, the allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). Therefore, sheep with at least one dominant allele will have a hairy fleece, while only those with only recessive alleles will have a woolly fleece.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two sheep. If the parents are heterozygous (Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nIn this scenario, there are three boxes (FF, Ff, Ff) representing offspring with a hairy fleece and one box (ff) representing offspring with a woolly fleece. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy fleece (FF or Ff) to those with a woolly fleece (ff) is 3:1.\n\nThe answer is E.",

In Farid's case, he wants to investigate which factors affect whether a pie crust will burn in the oven. He has two pie crusts made with white flour, a glass pie pan, an aluminum pie pan, and an oven. \n\nTo decide which question Farid can investigate, we need to match his supplies to the options provided. Option (A) requires additional supplies, such as pie filling for both types of pie. Option (B) requires aluminum foil, which Farid does not have. Option (C) requires a pie crust made with whole wheat flour, which Farid also does not have.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "61": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a smaller magnitude of the magnetic force.\n\nIn this case, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state and thus a physical change. The butter changes state from solid to liquid but remains the same type of matter. Sand and water mixing is also a change of state and a physical change. The sand and water mix together but remain the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Butter melting is caused by heating, but sand and water mixing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "453": "Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. Several factors can influence overall supply, such as changes in resource costs, the number of producers or suppliers, and expected changes in demand. When resources cost less or are easier to obtain, or when there are more producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go up. Conversely, when resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.\n\nIn this case, the number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Norwood decreased from seven to three, meaning there are fewer suppliers of men's shirts. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the overall supply of men's shirts in Norwood probably went down.\n\nThe answer is B.",

A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other, often using the words \"like\" and \"as.\" For example, \"My sister runs like a cheetah\" compares the sister's running to a cheetah's running using the word \"like,\" implying that the sister runs fast. Another example is \"The cat's fur was as dark as the night,\" where the cat's fur and the night are compared using the word \"as,\" meaning the cat's fur is dark.\n\nA metaphor, on the other hand, compares two things by saying that one of them is the other, without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"The snow formed a blanket over the town\" compares snow to a blanket without using \"like\" or \"as,\" suggesting that the snow covers the town completely.\n\nUsing similes and metaphors in writing can create vivid imagery for the reader. In this case, the sentence \"The tired boy was a slow turtle\" uses a metaphor because it compares the boy to a turtle without using \"like\" or \"as.\" The sentence \"The tired boy was as slow as a turtle\" uses a simile because it compares the boy to a turtle using the word \"as.\"\n\nThe answer is A.",

Plants are producers, meaning they make their own food inside special organelles called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain the pigment chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy from the sun. This energy is used to power a process called photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy. The chemical energy is used to produce sugar, which is the basis of the food that plants make.\n\nSo, can Polytrichum commune cells make their own food? Yes, they can. Polytrichum commune is a plant, and plants make their own food inside their cells. The answer is A.",
    "1056": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms, which can be linked together by chemical bonds to form molecules. In a chemical change, these chemical bonds break, and the atoms link together to form different molecules, resulting in different types of matter before and after the change. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling, such as burning paper, which is a chemical change caused by heating.\n\nIn contrast, physical changes do not break chemical bonds, and the types of molecules remain the same before and after the change. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling, such as water vaporizing, which is a physical change that can be caused by heating.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that mass is conserved in both physical and chemical changes, meaning the total mass remains the same before and after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change because the type of matter in it changes; the slice of bread turns brown. Cooking chicken is a chemical change because the type of matter in the chicken changes; the cooked chicken tastes different from the raw chicken.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different.

    "1113": "Genes, which are passed from parents to offspring, contain instructions that affect an organism's observable traits. These genes can have different alleles that cause variations in traits. For instance, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. A plant's genotype is its combination of alleles, such as FF, Ff, or ff, which determines its phenotype, or observable trait.\n\nAn organism with two identical alleles is homozygous, while one with two different alleles is heterozygous. Dominant alleles, like F, cause their trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. Recessive alleles, like f, only show their trait if no dominant allele is present.\n\nIn the context of coat color in horses, the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). Blossom's genotype is ll, meaning Blossom has two recessive alleles. Since the l allele is recessive and there are no dominant L alleles present, Blossom's phenotype must be the trait associated with the l allele.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "1315": "An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.\n\nLook at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has large teeth and a large mouth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The cougar uses its mouth to cut up meat into pieces it can swallow.\n\nNow look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The marmot has a small mouth and a short tail. Its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat.\n\nThe answer is A.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked, and the cookies are a different type of matter than the cookie dough. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, a physical change. The water changes from liquid to gas without forming a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating, but baking cookies is not.

In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of green particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter, so their concentrations are the same. The answer is B.",

A force is a push or a pull that can make an object start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. When pushing a stroller, the force increases with the weight of the kid in the stroller. Since the kid in the second stroller weighs 26 pounds, which is less than the 27 pounds in the first stroller, the force required to push the second stroller is less. Therefore, the stroller with the 26-pound kid is pushed with a smaller force. The answer is B.",

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Rust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change because the surface of the frame changes into a different type of matter. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change because when a penny is exposed to air, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different.

    "3504": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state and is a physical change. Liquid water changes into gas without forming a different type of matter. Dust settling out of the air is a change of state and is a physical change. Dust particles move around in the air and settle onto a surface without forming a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

Jellyfish and sea anemone are both part of the phylum Cnidaria, which comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean. Another phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey. The answer is A.",

    "3576": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state and is caused by heating, but the water changes from liquid to gas without forming a different type of matter. Stretching a rubber band is a physical change; the rubber band gets longer but remains the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are changes of state, which are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.

Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.\n\nThe long-beaked echidna has a long, thin mouth, which is adapted to get insects out of burrows. Now, let's analyze the options. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The aardvark has a large mouth and a long, straight mouth, which is not adapted to get insects out of burrows. The brown hyena has a large mouth and a long, thin mouth, which is adapted to get insects out of burrows.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "4357": "Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism and affect its observable traits. These genes can have different alleles that cause variations in traits. An organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, and its phenotype is the observable trait.\n\nIn the context of the rock pocket mouse, the gene for fur color has two alleles: F (dark fur) and f (light fur). The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). Ringo has a heterozygous genotype, Ff, meaning he has one dominant allele (F) and one recessive allele (f).\n\nSince the dominant allele (F) will express its trait even when paired with a recessive allele, Ringo's observable trait will be determined by the dominant allele. Therefore, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait will be dark fur.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Models simplify complex natural processes by representing how matter moves between organisms through arrows. Each arrow starts from the organism that is eaten and points to the organism that is doing the eating.\n\nTo determine which organism contains matter that was once part of the phytoplankton, we need to trace the paths of arrows in the food web. Phytoplankton is a primary producer, meaning it produces its own food inside cells using carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar, which serves as its food. Therefore, arrows in the food web that lead to phytoplankton have no other arrows pointing to them, indicating that matter does not pass through any other organisms before reaching phytoplankton.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n- An orca has only one arrow pointing to it, so matter does not pass through the orca.\n- A sea cucumber has numerous arrows pointing to it, so matter does pass through the sea cucumber.\n- A sea urchin has only one arrow pointing to it, so matter does not pass through the sea urchin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",

    "4933": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The crust turns brown, and the filling becomes soft and sweet. Plants making food from sunlight, air, and water is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.

Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the context of the pea plant's pod color trait, the allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D). Therefore, an organism with only dominant alleles (DD) will have green pods, while only organisms with recessive alleles (dd) will have yellow pods.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two pea plants. If the parents are heterozygous (Dd), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | D | d\nD | D | d\nd | d | dd\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype dd, which represents offspring with yellow pods. There are 2 boxes with the genotype Dd, which represents offspring with green pods.\n\nThe ratio of offspring with yellow pods (dd) to those with green pods (Dd) is 1:2.

    "5475": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The piece of paper is shorter in length, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before. Stapling an envelope shut is also a physical change. The envelope is smaller, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "6072": "Genes, which are passed from parents to offspring, contain instructions that affect an organism's observable traits. These genes can have different alleles that cause variations in traits. For instance, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. A plant's genotype is its combination of alleles, such as FF, Ff, or ff, which determines its phenotype, or observable trait.\n\nAn organism with two identical alleles is homozygous, while one with two different alleles is heterozygous. Dominant alleles, like F, cause their trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. Recessive alleles, like f, only show their trait if no dominant allele is present.\n\nIn the context of coat color in horses, the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). Therefore, a horse with the genotype ll has one dominant allele (L) and one recessive allele (l). Since the dominant allele (L) will express its trait even when the recessive allele (l) is present, Sage's phenotype will be the trait associated with the dominant allele.\n\nThe answer is A.",

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change.

This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\n\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\n\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!\n\nThe answer is C.",

The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. The butter changes from a solid to a liquid. Butter and liquid butter are made of the same type of matter: butter. Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are made of different types of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A copper statue turning green is a chemical change because the statue's surface changes into a different type of matter. Fire is not involved. Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change because the heat causes the clay to change into a different type of matter. The clay pot becomes fired and hard.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different.

    "8729": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of \"nauseous\" means causing disgust or nausea. Therefore, the first text, which uses \"nauseous\" to describe the odor emanating from the landfill, uses the word in its traditional sense. The second text, which uses \"nauseous\" to describe how the odor made Danielle feel, uses the word in its nontraditional sense, meaning feeling disgusted or nauseated.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "8732": "Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship. People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another. It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way. Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous! The answer is B.",

    "8749": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.\nsediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change where dirt and other particles suspended in water settle down and the water above becomes clearer.\ndry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state, a physical change where dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) changes into gas without forming a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes, not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nDry ice sublimating is caused by cooling, not heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nSediment settling is caused by gravity, not cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents the compound pyrite. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds.

    "9058": "A planet's volume indicates its size. In our solar system, planets are primarily composed of rock, gas, or ice. The volume of a planet is often expressed in scientific notation due to its large magnitude. For instance, Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3. To compare volumes, we first look at the exponents in scientific notation. If the exponents are equal, we then compare the coefficients.\n\nTo determine if Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times that of Mars, we calculate 10,000 times the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.62 x 10^12 km^3. Multiplying this by 10,000 gives us 1.62 x 10^17 km^3. Since 1.43 x 10^15 km^3 (Jupiter's volume) is less than 1.62 x 10^17 km^3, Jupiter's volume is not more than 10,000 times the volume of Mars.\n\nThe answer is B.",

To solve this problem, we need to examine each object and determine which property they all share. \n\nFirst, consider the appearance of the objects: a peanut, a pickle, a piece of paper, and a sock. Each object has a different appearance, so this property is not common to all.\n\nNext, examine the texture of the objects: a peanut, a pickle, a piece of paper, and a sock. Again, each object has a different texture, so this property is not shared by all.\n\nThen, taste the objects: a peanut, a pickle, a piece of paper, and a sock. Each object has a different taste, so this property is not common to all.\n\nFinally, smell the objects: a peanut, a pickle, a piece of paper, and a sock.

The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn this case, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is B.",

Arrows in a food web indicate the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another. To solve this problem, we need to trace the arrows to see which organism's matter was once part of the lichen.\n\nFirst, consider the lichen. Lichens are a symbiotic association of fungi and algae, where the fungi provide a habitat for the algae. Therefore, matter from the lichen comes from both the fungi and the algae. Arrows point from the fungi to other organisms, so matter from the fungal part of the lichen is not part of any other organism. However, arrows point from the algae to other organisms, so matter from the algal part of the lichen is part of other organisms.\n\nNext, consider each organism. The parasitic jaeger has only one arrow pointing to it, from the rough-legged hawk, so matter from the lichen is not part of the parasitic jaeger. The rough-legged hawk has only one arrow pointing to it, from the lichen, so matter from the lichen is part of the rough-legged hawk. The Arctic fox has only one arrow pointing to it, from the lichen, so matter from the lichen is part of the Arctic fox.

    "10256": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of green particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter, so their concentrations are the same.

The volume of Uranus is 68,300 billion km^3, and ten times that volume is 683,000 billion km^3. The volume of Saturn is 82,713 billion km^3. Since 683,000 billion km^3 is greater than 82,713 billion km^3, the volume of Saturn is indeed more than ten times the volume of Uranus. The answer is B.",
    "10522": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter, so their concentrations are the same.

    "10623": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating; ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. An egg being beaten is a physical change. The egg changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing is caused by cooling, but an egg being beaten is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn this case, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is A.",

For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\n\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group. You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group. By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.\n\nIn this experiment, Lester investigated whether pruning tomato plants affects how well they grow. So, the tomato plants that were pruned were part of an experimental group. There were no pruned tomato plants in the control group. The answer is B.",

    "11201": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a particular trait is determined by the combination of alleles in its genotype. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and this affects the organism's phenotype. If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nIn the context of the fruit fly's antennae, the allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a). Therefore, when crossing two fruit flies, the offspring will have either mutated antennae (A) or normal antennae (a), but not both.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two heterozygous flies (Aa x Aa). The Punnett square is as follows:\n | A | a\nA | AA | Aa\na | Aa | aa\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype AA, 2 boxes with the genotype Aa, and 1 box with the genotype aa. This results in the following phenotypic ratio:\n- Mutated antennae (AA or Aa): 3 boxes\n- Normal antennae (aa): 1 box\n\nTherefore, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to those with normal antennae is 3:1.

    "11480": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric gets a different shape, but it is made of the same type of matter. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. The lettuce and the dressing become mixed, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules.

    "12298": "An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat, while a long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.\n\nThe giant anteater has a tube-shaped snout that helps it reach into a burrow and a long, sticky tongue that helps it catch insects. Similarly, the long-beaked echidna has a long, straight snout that helps it reach into a burrow and a long, sticky tongue that helps it catch insects.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options. The giant anteater has a tube-shaped snout that helps it reach into a burrow and a long, sticky tongue that helps it catch insects. Similarly, the long-beaked echidna has a long, straight snout that helps it reach into a burrow and a long, sticky tongue that helps it catch insects. \n\nThe gorilla has a large mouth and a powerful jaw that help it tear through meat, not catch insects out of burrows. \n\nThe answer is B.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break.

In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent. The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.\n\nTo determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. Using the concentration formula (concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent), we can find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution B has more yellow particles per milliliter.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called a granular material. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water vaporizing is a change of state.

    "13599": "Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. Several factors can influence overall supply, such as changes in resource costs, the number of producers or suppliers, and expected changes in demand. When resources cost less or are easier to obtain, or when there are more producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go up. Conversely, when resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.\n\nIn this case, the number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Princeton decreased from seven to three, meaning there are fewer suppliers of men's shirts. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the overall supply of men's shirts in Princeton probably went down.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Since Edgar hiked up a tall mountain and moved higher toward the summit, the distance between him and the center of Earth increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit. The answer is B.",
    "13953": "In genetics, the coat pattern of an animal can be determined by two alleles: the dominant allele for solid coloring (A) and the recessive allele for white spots (a). When crossing two cows, we can use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of their offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous cows (Aa x Aa), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | A | a\nA | AA | Aa\na | Aa | aa\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box with AA, two boxes with Aa, and one box with aa. The phenotype probability table shows the probability that each genotype will have a specific trait. For example, an AA cow will have solid coloring, and an aa cow will have white spots.\n\nThe probability that a cow will have solid coloring (AA or AA) is calculated as follows:\nnumber of boxes with AA or AA / total number of boxes = 1 / 4\n\nThe probability that a cow will have white spots (aa or aa) is calculated as follows:\nnumber of boxes with aa or aa / total number of boxes = 1 / 4\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "14324": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change; the plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter as the unbroken plate. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change; the two are mixed together, but both are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Mixing is caused by heating, but breaking is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "16678": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

Therefore, a rabbit with at least one F allele will have black fur, while a rabbit with two f alleles will have brown fur.\n\nRingo has the genotype ff, meaning he has two recessive alleles. Since the f allele is recessive and there are no dominant F alleles present to mask its expression, Ringo's phenotype will be the trait associated with the recessive allele.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "16903": "Thermal energy is the energy that comes from the motion of particles within matter. Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold an object is, which correlates with the thermal energy of the object. When the temperature of an object decreases, the motion of its particles slows down, resulting in less thermal energy. Given that both bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their temperatures, the bowl at a lower temperature will have less thermal energy. Since the bowl of oatmeal at 35\u00b0C is colder than the bowl at 40\u00b0C, it has less thermal energy. The answer is A.",

When crossing two Syrian hamsters, we can use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of their offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous syrian hamsters (Ff x Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box with FF, two boxes with Ff, and one box with ff. The fur texture of the offspring will depend on their genotype. If they have at least one dominant allele (FF or Ff), their fur will be straight. If they have only recessive alleles (ff), their fur will be wavy.\n\nThe probability of an offspring having wavy fur (ff) is calculated as follows:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 1 / 4\n\nThe answer is E.",

    "17215": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies!\n\nThe answer is B.",

The passage mentions that summer is usually the hottest time of the year in Des Moines, which indicates a long-term pattern rather than a specific day's weather. The answer is B.",
    "17219": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change because the apple reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. Compost rotting is also a chemical change because the organic matter in the compost breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different.

    "17611": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state and thus a physical change. The wax melts but remains the same type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is also a change of state and a physical change. Water vaporizes but remains the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Melting wax is caused by heating, but rain is not. Both are caused by cooling.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Loosening an egg's shell is a physical change.

In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances. The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change. The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction. So, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products.\n\nMany watches are powered by small, flat batteries called button cells. One common type of button cell contains the metal zinc. When zinc in the battery combines with oxygen in the air, zinc oxide forms. This process generates the electricity that powers the watch. The underlined text tells you that when zinc in the battery combines with oxygen in the air, zinc oxide forms. This means that when zinc and oxygen react, or go through a chemical change, their atoms are rearranged to form zinc oxide. Because zinc oxide was formed in this chemical reaction, zinc oxide is a product.\n\nThe answer is A.",

The caterpillar can mimic the ants by copying their smell. The caterpillar can also make noises that make it sound like a queen ant. Queen ants receive more food and better protection than any other ants in the nest. So, when the caterpillar mimics an ant, the ants feed and protect the caterpillar instead of other ants in the nest.\n\nRelationships between organisms can be classified based on how they interact. A parasitic relationship is when one organism benefits at the expense of another. A mutualistic relationship is when both organisms benefit from the interaction. A commensal relationship is when one organism benefits while the other is unaffected.\n\nIn the described scenario, the Alcon blue caterpillar mimics an ant to receive food and protection from the Myrmica ants.

    "19818": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the crust changes. The type of matter in the filling changes. So, baking an apple pie is not a physical change. Making jam is a chemical change. The type of matter in the jam changes. So, making jam is not a physical change. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Baking is caused by heating. But making jam is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water freezing into ice is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. A paper clip can be bent without breaking, forming a new shape but still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

To solve this problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two heterozygous cockatiels.\n\nThe Punnett square for a cross between two heterozygous cockatiels (Rr x Rr) is as follows:\n | R | r\nR | AA | Aa\nr | Aa | aa\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype AA, 2 boxes with the genotype Aa, and 1 box with the genotype aa. The phenotype bright orange cheeks is produced by the allele R, while the phenotype pale orange cheeks is produced by the allele r. Therefore, the probability that an offspring will have bright orange cheeks is calculated as follows:\nnumber of boxes with genotype AA / total number of boxes = 1 / 4\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "20949": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A has more blue particles per milliliter. The answer is C.",
