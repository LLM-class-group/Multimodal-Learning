One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "text": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems.

(B) Both are chemical changes. (C) Both are only physical changes. (D) Both are caused by heating.", "text": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Burning a candle is also a chemical change because the wax in the candle reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Burning is caused by heating, but a piece of pizza rotting is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.", "answer_id": "gKnLvbzi6wbnVP9FqiFCTH", "model_id": "llava-vicuna-13b-v1.3-mini-realigned-2-12e", "metadata": {}}

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating; ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Ice melting in a cup is a change of state and is a physical change. The ice melts and changes from a solid to a liquid, but the melted ice and the original ice are made of the same type of matter: water.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state and is caused by heating, but the water changes from liquid to gas without forming a different type of matter.

Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are changes of state, which are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches a penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull. An old sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The crust turns brown, and the filling becomes soft and sweet. Plants making food from sunlight, air, and water is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

{"question_id": "6222", "prompt": "What do these two changes have in common?\na piece of pizza rotting in a trashcan\ncooking an egg\nContext: N/A\nOptions: (A) Both are chemical changes. (B) Both are caused by heating. (C) Both are caused by cooling. (D) Both are only physical changes.", "text": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. The matter in the egg before cooking and after cooking is different.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

The term was first introduced by Malcolm Gladwell in his 1999 book \"The Tipping Point.\" Gladwell defined a factoid as \"a piece of information that sounds like it ought to be true, even though it may not be.\" Many people today use \"factoid\" to describe a brief, unverified statement that is perceived to be true.\n\nIn the second text, \"Bert seemed to know a lot about African wildlife, but it turned out that his knowledge was mostly based on factoids gleaned from unreliable websites,\" the word \"factoid\" is used to describe brief, unverified statements. This use of \"factoid\" aligns with its popular definition, rather than its traditional sense as a brief fact that may or may not be true.\n\nIn the first text, \"Bert subscribed to an online newsletter about African wildlife; he enjoyed receiving daily factoids about the wild animals' natural habitats and behavior,\" the word \"factoid\" is used to describe brief, true facts.

(B) Both are chemical changes. (C) Both are caused by cooling. (D) Both are only physical changes.", "text": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Carving a piece of wood is a physical change.

The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.\n\nTo determine which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, we need to look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. Using the concentration formula (concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent), we can find the number of purple particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution A has more purple particles per milliliter.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A copper statue turning green is a chemical change because the statue's surface changes into a different type of matter. Fire is not involved. Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change because the heat causes the clay to change into a different type of matter.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. An iceberg melting is a change of state and thus a physical change. An different type of matter is not formed. An sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is also a change of state and a physical change.

Lichens are a symbiotic association of fungi and algae, where the fungi provide a habitat for the algae. Therefore, matter from the lichen comes from both the fungi and the algae. Arrows point from the fungi to other organisms, so matter from the fungal part of the lichen is not part of any other organism.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour", "text": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems.

For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change; the two remain separate and are not transformed into a different type of matter. Crushing a mineral into powder is also a physical change; the mineral is broken into smaller pieces, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncrushed mineral.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Crushing is caused by heating, but mixing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.", "answer_id": "K6Nay5wN9CDoC5L6KcYDhc", "model_id": "llava-vicuna-13b-v1.3-mini-realigned-2-12e", "metadata": {}}

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating; ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. An egg being beaten is a physical change. The egg changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

(B) Both are only physical changes. (C) Both are chemical changes. (D) Both are caused by heating.", "text": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change because the tarnish and the polish change into different types of matter. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: A piece of avocado turning brown is caused by heating, but using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.", "answer_id": "7C8bkjkRsvbfNfPXLiux9S", "model_id": "llava-vicuna-13b-v1.3-mini-realigned-2-12e", "metadata": {}}

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

{"question_id": "12123", "prompt": "What do these two changes have in common?\nwater evaporating from a puddle\nrain forming in a cloud\nContext: N/A\nOptions: (A) Both are only physical changes. (B) Both are chemical changes. (C) Both are caused by heating. (D) Both are caused by cooling.", "text": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water changes to gas without forming a different type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is also a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vaporizes and builds up in the cloud. But, it is not a different type of matter. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is formed. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water vaporizing is caused by heating. But, rain forming is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. \n\nThe answer is C.", "answer_id": "dVmeC4qhKN8CwSgoadJniP", "model_id": "llava-vicuna-13b-v1.3-mini-realigned-2-12e", "metadata": {}}

The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water vaporizing is a change of state. So, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. A chemical change happens when two or more types of matter link together to form a different type of matter. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. A physical change happens when matter changes state or is transformed without forming a different type of matter. Water vaporizing is a change of state. So, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe answer is A.", "answer_id": "bx9xmFroGMoALczxNquos8", "model_id": "llava-vicuna-13b-v1.3-mini-realigned-2-12e", "metadata": {}}

Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of \"nauseous\" means causing disgust or nausea. Therefore, the first text, \"Leah couldn't tolerate the nauseous odor emanating from the landfill, so she rolled up her car windows as she drove past,\" uses \"nauseous\" in its traditional sense. The second text, \"The odor emanating from the landfill made Leah so nauseous that she had to roll up the car windows as she drove past,\" uses \"nauseous\" in its nontraditional sense, meaning feeling disgusted or nauseated.\n\nThe answer is A.", "answer_id": "VhjJiLu2aFjv7jmVXCuMyf", "model_id": "llava-vicuna-13b-v1.3-mini-realigned-2-12e", "metadata": {}}

The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Isaac thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design.\nOptions: (A) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road (B) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design (C) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area", "text": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.

{"question_id": "16126", "prompt": "<image>\nBased on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nContext: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals.

This process is called a chemical reaction. In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances. The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change. The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction. So, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products.\n\nMany watches are powered by small, flat batteries called button cells. One common type of button cell contains the metal zinc. When zinc in the battery combines with oxygen in the air, zinc oxide forms. This process generates the electricity that powers the watch. The underlined text tells you that when zinc in the battery combines with oxygen in the air, zinc oxide forms. This means that when zinc and oxygen react, or go through a chemical change, their atoms are rearranged to form zinc oxide.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado and the air change into a different type of matter. Boiling sugar to make caramel is also a chemical change because the sugar and air change into a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different.

(B) Both are caused by cooling. (C) Both are caused by heating.", "text": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. \n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. \n\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. \n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the crust changes. The type of matter in the filling changes. So, baking an apple pie is not a physical change. Making jam is a chemical change. The type of matter in the jam changes. So, making jam is not a physical change. \n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets; a smaller distance results in a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn this case, there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

(B) Both are caused by heating. (C) Both are only physical changes. (D) Both are chemical changes.", "text": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change where the type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked, turning into cookies! Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change where the type of matter in the gate changes, forming a different type of matter that covers the gate.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Baking is caused by heating, but rust forming is not.
