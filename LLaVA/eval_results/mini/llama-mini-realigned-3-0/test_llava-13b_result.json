    "5": "The category of the problem is Engineering practices. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. To determine what a test can show, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\n\nIn Gordon's case, he was developing a parachute for a spacecraft landing on Mars. He needed to ensure the parachute would land smoothly without swinging wildly, which could damage the spacecraft. Gordon tested a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel simulating a speed of 200 km per hour to observe how much it swung.\n\nFirst, identify what was tested: a parachute with a 1 m vent. Then, identify what the test measured: how much the parachute swung at 200 km per hour.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Therefore, the text uses hyperbole. The answer is A.",
    "29": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Compost rotting is a chemical change where organic matter breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change where the apple's type of matter changes, causing it to look and taste different.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

In genetics, the fleece type trait in sheep is determined by a gene with two alleles: F (hairy fleece, dominant) and f (woolly fleece, recessive). To determine the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to those with a hairy fleece, we need to consider the genotypes produced by a cross.\n\nA Punnett square helps predict the genotypes of offspring from two parent sheep. If we assume the parents are heterozygous (Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nIn this scenario, there are three boxes ( FF, Ff, ff) representing offspring with a hairy fleece and one box (Ff) representing offspring with a woolly fleece. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to those with a hairy fleece is 1:3.\n\nThe answer is D.",

By examining the properties of each object, we can group them based on common characteristics. In this case, we need to determine which property is shared by all three objects.\n\nFirst, consider the properties of each object:\n- The slippers are slippery, meaning they are hard to stand on.\n- The crown is not slippery.\n- The vase is opaque, meaning it does not let light through.\n- The crown is not opaque.\n- The slippers are not crown-shaped.\n- The crown is not slippery.\n- The vase is not shiny.\n- The crown is shiny, meaning it reflects a lot of light and often allows seeing its own shape.\n\nSince the crown is shiny, we can group the objects based on this property.

In Farid's case, he wants to investigate which factors affect whether a pie crust will burn in the oven. He has two pie crusts made with white flour, a glass pie pan, an aluminum pie pan, and an oven. \n\nTo determine which question Farid can investigate, we need to match his supplies to the options provided. Option (A) requires a pie crust made with whole wheat flour, which Farid does not have. Option (B) involves covering the pie crust with aluminum foil, which Farid can do with his available supplies. Option (C) involves comparing pie crusts made with different types of flour, which Farid can also do with his two pie crusts made with white flour.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "61": "The category of the problem is Velocity, acceleration, and forces. Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the size of the magnets; smaller magnets exert a smaller magnetic force. In this scenario, Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, but Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Several factors can influence overall supply, such as changes in resource costs, the number of producers or suppliers, and expected changes in demand. When resources cost less or are easier to obtain, or when there are more producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go up. Conversely, when resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.\n\nIn this case, the number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Norwood decreased from seven to three, meaning there are fewer suppliers of men's shirts. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the overall supply of men's shirts in Norwood probably went down.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "456": "The category of the problem is Literary devices. Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike. A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other, often using the words \"like\" and \"as.\" For example, \"My sister runs like a cheetah\" compares the sister's running to a cheetah's running using the word \"like,\" implying that the sister runs fast. Another example is \"The cat's fur was as dark as the night,\" which compares the cat's fur to the night using the word \"as,\" meaning the cat's fur is dark.\n\nA metaphor, on the other hand, compares two things by saying that one of them is the other, without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"The snow formed a blanket over the town\" compares the snow to a blanket without using \"like\" or \"as,\" suggesting that the snow covers the town completely.\n\nUsing similes and metaphors in writing can create vivid imagery for the reader. In this case, the sentence \"The tired boy was a slow turtle\" uses a metaphor because it compares the boy to a turtle without using \"like\" or \"as.\" The sentence \"The tired boy was as slow as a turtle\" uses a simile because it compares the boy to a turtle using the word \"as.\"\n\nThe answer is A.",

For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of \"factoid\" is an item of unreliable information that is often repeated as if it were true. In the second text, \"As a geneticist, Suzie enjoys watching science documentaries and sharing various factoids she's learned with her colleagues,\" the word \"factoid\" is used in its traditional sense. In contrast, the first text uses \"factoid\" in its nontraditional sense of a brief interesting fact: \"As a geneticist, Suzie dislikes many popular sci-fi movies because they often present audiences with factoids that misrepresent her field.\"\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "470": "The category of the problem is Solutions. A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, you need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

    "1253": "The category of the problem is Designing experiments. Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. To identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\n\nIn Kira's experiment, she prepared ten buckets, each with one gallon of boiling water and three tablespoons of black fabric dye. She soaked white linen fabric squares in five of the buckets and white cotton fabric squares in the other five buckets. All of the fabric squares were soaked for 15 minutes. After the fabric dried, Kira scored the darkness of the squares on a scale from light to dark. She compared the darkness of the linen fabric to the darkness of the cotton fabric.\n\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. In this case, the type of fabric (linen vs. cotton) was tested. Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured, which is the darkness of the fabric squares.\n\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, Kira's experiment can answer questions about how the type of fabric affects the darkness of the dyed fabric.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "1282": "The category of the problem is Units and measurement. Temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) or degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F). To compare these units, consider the following reference points:\n- Water boils at 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C)\n- Normal body temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C)\n- Room temperature is around 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C)\n- Water freezes at 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C)\n\nGiven these comparisons, 3\u00b0F is much colder than 3\u00b0C. For context, 3\u00b0F is the temperature at which water changes from liquid to solid, while 3\u00b0C is a comfortable room temperature. Therefore, the better estimate for the temperature of a cold glass of water is 3\u00b0C. The answer is A.",
    "1286": "The category of the problem is Chemical reactions. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Burning a candle is also a chemical change because the wax matter in the candle reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, with different types of matter before and after each change. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.\n\nLook at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has large, sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The cougar uses its teeth to cut up meat into pieces it can swallow. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The tiger has a similar adaptation. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The marmot does not have a similar adaptation.

For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of \"disinterested\" means unbiased or impartial. In the second text, \"playing history-based trivia games will revive even the most disinterested of students,\" the word \"disinterested\" is used in its nontraditional sense, meaning uninterested or indifferent.

In this case, we need to determine which property is shared by all four objects.\n\nFirst, consider the properties of each object:\n- The car bumper is rough and scratches the paint on the other car.\n- The glass cup is fragile and breaks easily.\n- The metal door is hard and does not change shape when pressed.\n- The wooden table is smooth and not scratchy when touched.\n\nAs you can see, none of the properties are common to all four objects. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the options given: opaque, fragile, and smooth. Each object is either opaque or transparent, fragile or strong, and smooth or rough. Therefore, we can group the objects based on these properties.\n\nThe answer is A.",

When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. The magnets in Pair 1 attract, and the magnets in Pair 2 repel. Whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force, not its magnitude. Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Since the sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2 and the distance between the magnets is also the same, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

    "2531": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

An organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, and its phenotype is the observable version of that trait.\n\nIn the context of the budgerigar parakeets, the gene for body feather color has two alleles: B (dominant, green body feathers) and b (recessive, blue body feathers). Iago has a homozygous genotype bb, meaning Iago has two recessive alleles.\n\nSince the b allele is recessive and Iago has two b alleles, Iago's phenotype will express the recessive trait. Therefore, Iago will have blue body feathers.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "2785": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Milk going sour is a chemical change because the milk changes into a different type of matter, such as yogurt or cheese. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change because the bread changes into a different type of matter, too, becoming crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating, but milk going sour is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state and is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to gas, but the water vapor is made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.

    "3576": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state and is a physical change where liquid water changes into gas without forming a different type of matter. Stretching a rubber band is also a change of state and is a physical change where the rubber band gets longer but remains the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating, but not in the same way. Water evaporating is caused by heating the lake, but stretching a rubber band is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "4357": "The category of the problem is Genes to traits. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism and affect its observable traits. These genes can have different alleles that cause different versions of a trait. An organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, and its phenotype is the observable version of that trait.\n\nIn Ringo's case, the gene for fur color in rock pocket mice has two alleles: F (dark fur) and f (light fur). The allele F is dominant over the allele f. Ringo has a heterozygous genotype, Ff, meaning he has one dominant allele (F) and one recessive allele (f).\n\nSince the dominant allele (F) will express its trait even when paired with a recessive allele, Ringo's phenotype will be determined by the dominant allele. Therefore, Ringo will have dark fur.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Bleaching clothes is a chemical change because the clothes' color changes, and the clothes are made of a different type of matter after bleaching. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change because the apple's color changes, and the apple is made of a different type of matter after it turns brown.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Neither change is caused by heating.

    "6185": "The category of the problem is Genes to traits. Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes, which contain the instructions that affect these traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits, on the other hand, are gained during a person's life and are not passed down from parents to offspring. Given this information, the conclusion that Cooper inherited the trait of straight hair is supported by the fact that Cooper's parents were born with straight hair and passed down this trait to him.

    "6222": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The pizza changes into a different type of matter. Cooking an egg is also a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are different types of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Cooking is caused by heating.

    "6470": "The category of the problem is Chemical reactions. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a physical change. So, dry ice and the gas that is created are made of the same type of matter: carbon dioxide. The answer is B.",

To identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\n\nIn Natalie's experiment, she prepared ten buckets, each with one gallon of boiling water and three tablespoons of black fabric dye. She soaked white linen fabric squares in five of the buckets and white cotton fabric squares in the other five buckets. All of the fabric squares were soaked for 15 minutes. After the fabric dried, Natalie scored the darkness of the squares on a scale from light to dark. She compared the darkness of the linen fabric to the darkness of the cotton fabric.\n\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. In this case, the type of fabric (linen vs. cotton) was tested. Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured, which is the darkness of the fabric squares.\n\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, Natalie's experiment can answer questions about how the type of fabric affects the darkness of the dyed fabric.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "7038": "The category of the problem is Adaptations. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large neck with powerful muscles might help an animal lift heavy objects, while a long, thin neck might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. The great egret has a long, thin neck that helps it grab fish while keeping the rest of its body still. Now, let's look at each animal to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The mallard has a long, thin neck that it uses to catch insects and small fish. The painted stork has a long, thin neck that it uses to catch fish and other aquatic invertebrates. The painted stork's adaptation is similar to the great egret's adaptation. The answer is B.",

Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions that affect an organism's traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes can have different alleles, which can cause different versions of a trait. For example, the gene for flower color in pea plants has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff. The phenotype is the observable trait, such as purple or white flowers, depending on the genotype.\n\nIn the context of the leg color gene in chickens, the allele L is for white legs, and the allele l is for yellow legs. Chitters has white legs and two alleles for white legs, indicating a genotype of LL. The answer is A.",

When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the size of the magnets; a smaller magnet exerts a smaller magnetic force. In this scenario, Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, but Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

    "7085": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Carving a piece of wood is a physical change because the wood gets a different shape, but the type of matter remains the same. Sewing an apron is also a physical change because the pieces of fabric get a different shape and are joined together, but the type of matter remains the same.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "7892": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change because the metal gate changes into a different type of matter. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change because the bread gets broken down into a different type of matter that can be used by the body.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling.

The armored catfish's mouth is located on the underside of its head. Its mouth points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding. The armored catfish uses its mouth to find food hidden in the sediment at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.\n\nNow look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The bat ray's mouth is located on the underside of its head. Its mouth points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding. The clown triggerfish's mouth is not located on the underside of its head. Its mouth is not adapted for bottom feeding.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "8200": "The category of the problem is Editing and revising. Improving grammar and mechanics involves addressing specific issues such as verb tense, modifiers, and punctuation. To determine the best way for the writer to improve, we need to identify these problems in the provided excerpt.\n\nFirst, consider verb tense. The writer uses the present tense to describe actions that have already happened (e.g., \"When my grandparents first bought a computer, they didn't know how to use the Internet\"). This inconsistency can be corrected by using consistent verb tenses.\n\nNext, examine modifiers. A misplaced modifier occurs when a word or phrase is placed in a sentence in a way that makes it unclear which word or phrase it is modifying. For example, in the sentence \"When my grandparents first bought a computer, they didn't know how to use the Internet,\" the phrase \"they didn't know how to use the Internet\" is a misplaced modifier because it is not clear who didn't know how to use the Internet. This can be corrected by rewriting the sentence for clarity.\n\nFinally, consider punctuation. Commas are important for clarity and to prevent confusion. For instance, in the sentence \"When my grandparents first bought a computer, they didn't know how to use the Internet,\" the comma after \"first bought\" is misplaced and can be corrected by removing it.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In classical conditioning, an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, and it begins to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For instance, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones. The answer is A.",

    "8321": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Beating an egg is a chemical change because the type of matter in the egg changes; the egg white and egg yolk are mixed together. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change because the lettuce and dressing remain separate.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, but they are not the same type of chemical change.

A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A copper statue turning green is a chemical change because the statue's color changes from its original color to a different color. Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is also a chemical change because the clay pot's material changes from clay to a different material that is stronger and less likely to break.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating.

    "8779": "The category of the problem is Velocity, acceleration, and forces. A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object, and every force has a direction and a magnitude. When two forces act on an object in opposite directions and have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object. Conversely, if the forces have different magnitudes, they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force on the object.\n\nTo determine if there is a net force on the ice cube, we examine the forces: Earth's gravity is pulling the ice cube down with a force of 0.1 N, and the water is pushing the ice cube up with a force of 0.1 N. Since these forces are in opposite directions and have the same magnitude, they are balanced. Therefore, there is no net force on the ice cube.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "9058": "The category of the problem is Astronomy. A planet's volume indicates its size. In our solar system, planets are primarily composed of rock, gas, or ice. The volume of a planet is often expressed in scientific notation due to its large magnitude. For instance, Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3. To compare volumes, we first look at the exponents in scientific notation. If the exponents are equal, we then compare the coefficients.\n\nTo determine if Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times that of Mars, we calculate 10,000 times the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.53 x 10^14 km^3. Multiplying this by 10,000 gives us 1.53 x 10^18 km^3. Since 1.43 x 10^15 km^3 (Jupiter's volume) is less than 1.53 x 10^18 km^3, Jupiter's volume is not more than 10,000 times that of Mars.\n\nThe answer is B.",

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass.

    "9620": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and water is a physical change where the sand and water become mixed, but they are still made of the same type of matter. Carving a piece of wood is also a physical change, where the wood is changed in shape, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes.

When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. In this case, the magnets in Pair 2 attract, and the magnets in Pair 1 repel. However, whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force, not its magnitude. Both the sizes of the magnets and the distance between them affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.

To identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\n\nIn Barbara's experiment, she prepared ten buckets, each with one gallon of boiling water and three tablespoons of black fabric dye. She soaked white linen fabric squares in five of the buckets and white cotton fabric squares in the other five buckets. All of the fabric squares were soaked for 15 minutes. After the fabric dried, Barbara scored the darkness of the squares on a scale from light to dark. She compared the darkness of the linen fabric to the darkness of the cotton fabric.\n\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. In this case, the type of fabric (linen vs. cotton) was tested. Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured, which is the darkness of the fabric squares.\n\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, Barbara's experiment can answer questions about how the type of fabric affects the darkness of the dyed fabric.\n\nThe answer is B.",

When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. In this case, the magnets in Pair 2 attract, and the magnets in Pair 1 repel. However, whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force, not its magnitude. Both the sizes of the magnets and the distance between them affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.

    "10256": "The category of the problem is Solutions. A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, you need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter, you can see that Solution A has more green particles per milliliter.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "10623": "The category of the problem is Chemical reactions. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state, so it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. An egg beating is a physical change. The muscles in an animal's body move, and this movement causes the animal's body to change shape. But a beaten egg is still made of the same type of matter as an unbeaten egg.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating.

Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change because the tarnish is a different type of matter that is removed, and the silver spoon is cleaned and shiny after the change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "11218": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. This law helps scientists understand how matter has changed over time.

    "11559": "The category of the problem is Ecosystems. An environment includes all of the biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) things in an area. An ecosystem is created by the relationships that form among the biotic and abiotic parts of an environment. There are many different types of terrestrial (land-based) ecosystems, which can differ in climate, soil type, and the organisms that live there. Here are some ways in which ecosystems can differ from each other:\n\n* Climate: An environment's climate is its pattern of weather, which can include temperature and precipitation. Different climates can create different ecosystems. For example, a hot summer and a cold winter are two different climates. Tundras are ecosystems that have cold winters and warm summers. So, an environment with many evergreen trees and mostly small plants might not be a tundra. But an environment with warm summers and cool winters might be a tundra.\n* Soil type: An environment's soil type can affect which organisms can live there. For example, soil that is poor in nutrients can make it hard for plants to grow. Most tundras have poor soil. So, an environment with many evergreen trees might not be a tundra. But an environment with poor soil might be a tundra.\n* Organisms: The organisms that live in an environment can affect how it works. For example, organisms that eat different things can affect which plants and animals are living there. Most tundras have small plants and animals.

    "11583": "The category of the problem is Genes to traits. In genetics, the phenotype of an organism is determined by its genotype, which consists of alleles that can be either dominant or recessive. For the ear type trait in rats, the allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e). Therefore, an organism with at least one dominant allele (EE or Ee) will have normal ears, while only those with the genotype ee will have dumbo ears.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two heterozygous rats (Ee x Ee). The Punnett square is as follows:\n | E | e\nE | AA | Ee\ne | Ee | ee\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype AA, 2 boxes with the genotype Ee, and 1 box with the genotype ee. This results in the following phenotypic ratio:\n- Normal ears (AA or Ee): 3 boxes\n- Dumbo ears (ee): 1 box\n\nTherefore, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to those with normal ears is 1:3. The answer is B.",

Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, while its phenotype is the observable version of a trait. In the case of Tora, a leopard with a black coat, the gene for the coat pattern has two alleles: A for a spotted coat and a for a black coat. Tora has two alleles for a black coat, making her genotype aa. Therefore, Tora's phenotype, the observable trait, is a black coat.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "11845": "The category of the problem is Ecosystems. An environment includes all of the biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) things in an area. An ecosystem is created by the relationships that form among the biotic and abiotic parts of an environment. There are many different types of terrestrial (land-based) ecosystems, which can differ in climate, soil type, and the organisms that live there. Here are some ways in which terrestrial ecosystems can differ from each other:\n\n* Climate: An environment's climate is its long-term weather pattern. Terrestrial ecosystems can differ in their climate, which is determined by their location and the patterns of weather in their area. For example, ecosystems in warm, wet climates are different from ecosystems in cold, dry climates.\n* Soil type: Soil is made up of the material that is broken down and decomposed by organisms and the matter that is brought in from the outside. Different types of soil have different properties, such as their texture and the nutrients they contain. Soil that is poor in nutrients does not have many of the nutrients that plants need to grow.\n* Organisms: An environment's organisms are the living things that are there. Terrestrial ecosystems can differ in the organisms that live there, which can be influenced by the climate and soil type. For example, ecosystems in cold, dry climates with poor soil are different from ecosystems in warm, wet climates with rich soil.\n\nThe savanna grassland ecosystem has warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. It also has many different types of organisms. The answer is A.",

For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to consider both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.\n\nSolution B has more yellow particles per milliliter. The answer is C.",

    "12123": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state and is a physical change. Liquid water changes into gas without forming a different type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is also a change of state and is a physical change. Water vapor in the cloud changes into liquid water without forming a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by the puddle heating up. Rain forming is caused by water vaporizing and falling back to the ground as rain. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "12399": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cooking an egg is a chemical change where the matter in the egg changes, and the egg becomes harder to cook. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change where the matter in the penny changes, and the penny becomes dull.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Cooking is caused by heating, but a penny tarnishing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Jayce checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar.\n\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In this case, the type of liquid in the test tubes (water vs. vinegar) was tested.\n\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations.

    "12677": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas is a change of state and is a physical change. The dry ice changes from a solid to a gas, but the gas is made of the same type of matter as the dry ice. Water freezing into ice is also a change of state and is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but the ice is made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Both changes are caused by cooling, but they are physical changes, not chemical changes.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "12722": "The category of the problem is Chemical reactions. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Bees making honey from nectar is a chemical change. Nectar is made of sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than honey. Honey is made of sugar and other things. The bees add enzymes to the nectar. The enzymes break the sugar into smaller pieces. The bees then add water to the nectar. The water is mixed into the sugar. The water and sugar are now honey. The type of matter before and after the change is different. The answer is A.",

Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous cows (Aa x Aa), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | A | a\nA | AA | Aa\na | Aa | aa\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box with AA, two boxes with Aa, and one box with aa. The probability of each genotype is calculated as follows:\n- AA: 1 box / 4 boxes\n- Aa: 2 boxes / 4 boxes\n- aa: 1 box / 4 boxes\n\nThe total probability of an offspring having solid coloring (AA or Aa) is calculated as follows:\n- AA: 1 box / 4 boxes\n- Aa: 2 boxes / 4 boxes\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "14324": "The category of the problem is Chemical reactions. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the unbroken plate. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The two things mix together, but the mixture is still made of the same type of matter as the milk and the syrup.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "16221": "The category of the problem is Velocity, acceleration, and forces. Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. In this case, the magnets in Pair 2 attract, and the magnets in Pair 1 repel. However, whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force, not its magnitude. Both the sizes of the magnets and the distance between them affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Since the sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2, and the distance between the magnets is also the same, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. The answer is A.",
    "16223": "The category of the problem is Genes to traits. In genetics, the fur color of a Labrador retriever can be determined by two alleles: the dominant allele for black fur (F) and the recessive allele for brown fur (f). When crossing two Labrador retrievers, we can use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of their offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous Labrador retrievers (Ff x Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box with FF, two boxes with Ff, and one box with ff. The fur color of the offspring will depend on their genotype: black fur (FF) is dominant over brown fur (Ff).\n\nThe probability of an offspring having brown fur (ff) is calculated as follows:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 1 / 4\n\nThe answer is C.",

At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\n\nTo figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Thingvellir Rift Valley, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. The passage explains that the Thingvellir Rift Valley began to form as the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate moved away from each other. This means that the two plates were moving away from each other, which is characteristic of a divergent boundary.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "17269": "The category of the problem is Kinetic and potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects, including an object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the object's mass and its distance from the center of Earth. When an object moves higher, the distance between it and the center of Earth increases, leading to an increase in gravitational potential energy. Conversely, when an object moves lower, the distance between it and the center of Earth decreases, leading to a decrease in gravitational potential energy. In this scenario, the skydiver moved higher before opening her parachute and then moved lower as she drifted toward the flat ground. Therefore, the distance between the skydiver and the center of Earth increased before she opened her parachute and decreased after she opened it. This indicates that the gravitational potential energy stored between the skydiver and Earth increased as she drifted toward the flat ground. The answer is A.",

    "17611": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state and is a physical change. The wax changes from a solid to a liquid but remains wax. Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state and is a physical change. Water vaporizes and forms rain, but the rain is still made of the same type of matter as the water vapor.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. Boiling sugar to make caramel is also a chemical change because the sugar reacts with water to form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different.

In genetics, the phenotype of an organism is determined by its genotype, which consists of alleles that can be either dominant or recessive. For the rose plant, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F (light yellow flowers, dominant) and f (dark yellow flowers, recessive). When crossing two plants, we can use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of their offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype outcome from the combination of the parents' alleles.\n\nFor a cross between two heterozygous plants (Ff x Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring: one box with FF, two boxes with Ff, and one box with ff. The box with ff represents the genotype with dark yellow flowers.\n\nThe probability of an event is calculated as the number of ways the event can happen divided by the number of equally likely outcomes.

The passage mentions that it was clear and sunny yesterday on the Croatian coast, indicating the atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place. Therefore, this passage describes the weather. The answer is A.",
    "21146": "The category of the problem is Physical and chemical change. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change because the type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked, turning into cookies! Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change because the matter in the gate changes, forming a different type of matter that covers the gate.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",
    "21147": "The category of the problem is Developing and supporting arguments. Logical fallacies can undermine an argument by introducing irrelevant information or misrepresenting the issues at hand. In the given text, the argument suggests that good students will study the material regardless of a test, while bad students won't study the material even for a test. This reasoning ignores the possibility that some students may study for tests out of habit or to improve their grades, even if they are not necessarily \"good\" students. Therefore, the text uses false dichotomy, an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist. The answer is B.",

    "21153": "The category of the problem is Kinetic and potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects, including an object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the object's mass and its distance from the center of Earth. When an object moves higher, the distance between it and the center of Earth increases, leading to an increase in gravitational potential energy. Conversely, when an object moves lower, the distance between it and the center of Earth decreases, leading to a decrease in gravitational potential energy. In this scenario, the water balloon fell toward Dale, meaning it moved lower. Therefore, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. Since the water balloon's mass did not change, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Dale. The answer is A.",
    "21159": "The category of the problem is Phrases and clauses. A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate. An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence, while a dependent clause is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone. A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause. A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as \"and,\" \"but,\" or \"so.\" A complex sentence includes an independent clause and a dependent clause, often beginning with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. A compound-complex sentence contains two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.\n\nThe sentence \"Joel took several incredible panoramic photographs of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain\" is a complex sentence. It consists of an independent clause \"Joel took several incredible panoramic photographs\" and a dependent clause \"of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain,\" which begins with the subordinating conjunction \"of.\"\n\nThe answer is C.",
    "21166": "The category of the problem is States of matter. Matter can exist in different states: solid, liquid, and gas. When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and shape. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. Gases have neither a definite volume nor shape and expand to fill their container. Chocolate syrup is a liquid because it takes the shape of any container it is in while maintaining a consistent volume. The answer is B.",

    "21195": "The category of the problem is Reference skills. Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary and indicate the first and last words on that page. Words on the page fall alphabetically between these guide words. To determine the correct word, you compare the words alphabetically by their letters. If the first letters are the same, you move to the second letters, and so on. If one word is shorter and there are no more letters to compare, the shorter word comes first. For example, \"be\" comes before \"bed.\" \n\nSince \"peach\" falls alphabetically between \"pad\" and \"poison,\" it would be found on that page. The answer is B.",
    "21196": "The category of the problem is Geography. To determine which state is farthest west, we need to understand the cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. On most maps, north is at the top, and west is to the left. By comparing the positions of the states, we can see that South Carolina is the farthest west among the given options. The answer is C.",

    "21200": "The category of the problem is Force and motion. A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to another. Every force has a direction. The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing, while the direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling. In this scenario, the bulldozer is pushing loose dirt out of the way. Therefore, the direction of the push is away from the bulldozer. The answer is A.",
    "21206": "The category of the problem is Sentences, fragments, and run-ons. A complete sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought, containing both a subject and a verb. In this case, we need to identify which option meets these criteria.\n\nOption (A) \"Amy is from Greenwood now she lives in Wildgrove.\" is a run-on sentence because it contains two independent clauses joined only by a comma.\n\nOption (B) \"This book explains the difference between cattle and buffalo.\" is a complete sentence because it has a subject (\"This book\") and a verb (\"explains\"), and it forms a complete thought.\n\nThe answer is B."
