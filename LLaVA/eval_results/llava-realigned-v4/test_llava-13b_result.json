    "26": "To determine how long it takes to bake lasagna in the oven, let's consider some background knowledge. Baking times for lasagna typically range from 30 to 50 minutes, depending on the recipe and oven temperature. For example, several recipes suggest baking lasagna for 45 minutes, with the dish covered except for the last 10 minutes. Additionally, in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, lasagna should be perfectly baked in about 50 minutes, with 30-40 minutes covered and 5-10 minutes uncovered. \n\nGiven these details, the better estimate for the time it takes to bake lasagna in the oven is 33 minutes. Baking lasagna for 33 hours is excessively long and unrealistic. Therefore, the answer is 33 minutes.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "29": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and eggshells. Compost rotting is a chemical change because it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter. A piece of apple turning brown is also a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter. If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white, indicating the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the apple.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",
    "42": "The fleece type trait in sheep is determined by two alleles: the dominant allele (F) for a hairy fleece and the recessive allele (f) for a woolly fleece. To determine the expected ratio of offspring with different fleece types, we can use a Punnett square. \n\nConsider the following Punnett square for a cross between two heterozygous sheep (Ff):\n\n|   | F | f |\n|---|---|---|\n| F | FF | Ff |\n| f | Ff | ff |\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the following genotypes:\n- FF (hairy fleece) - 1 box\n- Ff (hairy fleece) - 2 boxes\n- ff (woolly fleece) - 1 box\n\nSince the F allele is dominant, both FF and Ff genotypes will result in a hairy fleece, while the ff genotype will result in a woolly fleece. Therefore, there are 3 boxes for a hairy fleece and 1 box for a woolly fleece.\n\nThe expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 1:3. The answer is A.",

To determine which question Farid can investigate with these supplies, we need to analyze each option:\n\n(A) Does a pie crust made with white flour burn more quickly when the pie is cooked in a glass pan or in an aluminum pan? - This question can be investigated because Farid has both a glass pie pan and an aluminum pie pan available.\n\n(B) Do pie crusts made with white flour burn less quickly when covered with aluminum foil or when left uncovered? - This question cannot be investigated because Farid does not have aluminum foil listed in his supplies.\n\n(C) Does a pie crust made with white flour burn more quickly than a pie crust made with whole wheat flour? - This question cannot be investigated because Farid only has pie crusts made with white flour.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "61": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

    "128": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Mixing sand and water is also a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet, but both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating, but mixing sand and water is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "470": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent, using the formula: concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of green particles per milliliter.\n\nAfter analyzing the diagram, it is clear that Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. Therefore, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles. The answer is A.",

    "534": "Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms, which are always moving. The energy of these moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up, resulting in both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\n\nWhen considering the amount of matter, a larger amount of the same type of matter at the same temperature will have more thermal energy. For example, a 2-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F because it has twice as many atoms.\n\nIn this problem, the two drops of honey are made of the same material and have the same mass. Therefore, the drop of honey with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature.\n\nThe answer is B.",

For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of \"disinterested\" means unbiased or impartial. In the first text, \"As a teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell tries to remain disinterested when discussing controversial issues, giving equal attention and consideration to each major viewpoint,\" the word \"disinterested\" is used in its traditional sense. This means that Mr. McDowell tries to be unbiased and give equal attention to all viewpoints.\n\nIn the second text, \"As an experienced teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell believes that playing history-based trivia games will revive even the most disinterested of students,\" the word \"disinterested\" is used in its nontraditional sense, meaning uninterested or indifferent.\n\nMost style guides recommend using the traditional sense of the word \"disinterested\" because it is considered more standard.

    "1056": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change.

    "1123": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance copper. In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. The color of a ball represents a specific chemical element. The atomic symbol for that chemical element is shown in the legend. Use the model to determine whether beryllium is an elementary substance or a compound.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Interpret the model. In the space-filling model shown above, all of the balls are the same color. The legend shows that green represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol Be.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths. Look at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The cougar uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The marmot has large front teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The marmot uses its mouth to gnaw on stems and branches.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is A.",

    "1326": "Solid and liquid are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space and can come in different states or forms. When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own. Some solids can be bent or broken easily, while others are hard to bend or break. A glass cup and a sock are examples of solids. When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container. For example, when you pour a liquid from a cup into a bottle, the shape of the liquid changes to fit the new container, but it still takes up the same amount of space. Juice and honey are examples of liquids. A change of state is a change from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid. For example, water vaporizing is a change of state because liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. Water in a sink is a liquid because it takes the shape of the sink. If you move the water into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container while still taking up the same amount of space. The answer is A.",

The dominant allele will mask the presence of a recessive allele in the phenotype. For the body size trait in rats, the allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B).\n\nTo determine the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body, we use a Punnett square. This square helps predict the genotypic and phenotypic outcomes of a genetic cross. Consider the following Punnett square for a cross between two heterozygous rats (Bb):\n\n | B | b\nB | BB | Bb\nb | Bb | bb\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype BB, 2 boxes with the genotype Bb, and 1 box with the genotype bb. The BB and Bb genotypes will result in a normal-sized body because the B allele is dominant. The bb genotype will result in a dwarf body because it has only recessive alleles.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 boxes representing offspring with a normal-sized body (BB and Bb) and 1 box representing offspring with a dwarf body (bb).

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Plants making food is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break.

The energy of these moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and the speed at which the atoms are moving.\n\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. When atoms move faster, the temperature increases, resulting in more thermal energy. For example, a 2-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F because it has twice as many atoms.\n\nIn this problem, the two pieces of rope are made of the same material and have the same mass. Therefore, the hotter piece of rope has more thermal energy because its atoms are moving faster. The answer is A.",

    "2779": "Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism and affect its observable traits. Genes may have different alleles that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, such as FF, Ff, or ff for flower color. The phenotype is the observable version of the trait, like purple or white flowers. Traits controlled by a single gene have a genotype made up of two alleles, determining whether an organism is homozygous (two identical alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles). Dominant alleles cause their version of the trait to appear even when a recessive allele is present. For example, F is dominant over f, so a plant with FF or Ff will have purple flowers. Recessive alleles only show their trait when no dominant allele is present, so ff results in white flowers.\n\nIn the context of budgerigar parakeets, the gene for body feather color has two alleles: B for green feathers (dominant) and b for blue feathers (recessive). Iago has the genotype bb, meaning Iago has two recessive alleles. Since the b allele is recessive, Iago's phenotype will be blue body feathers. The answer is A.",

    "2785": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The crust and the inside of the loaf are different types of matter than the original dough.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "2900": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Ice melting is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water. Dew appearing on grass in the morning is also a change of state, so it is a physical change. The dew forms when water vapor in the air condenses into liquid water on the grass.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Ice melting is caused by heating, but dew appearing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Dew appears when water vapor in the air condenses. This is caused by cooling, but ice melting is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "3115": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\n\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\n\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is A.",

    "3504": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

Invertebrates make up the majority of Earth's living things, and there are many different groups, or phyla, of invertebrates. Jellyfish and sea anemone are both part of the phylum Cnidaria, which comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\n\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Rover has long fur and two alleles for long fur. So, Rover's genotype must be ff. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. Rover's observable version of the fur length trait is long fur.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute.

    "3710": "Phosphorus tribromide is used to make certain types of medicine. The chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide is PBr3. There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\n\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\n\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\n\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.\n\nYou can tell whether phosphorus tribromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide, PBr3, contains two atomic symbols: P for phosphorus and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that phosphorus tribromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together. Since phosphorus tribromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphorus tribromide is a compound. The answer is A.",

    "4282": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull. A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is A.",

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

    "4603": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change.

    "4933": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown. Plants making food is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But plants making food is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is A.",

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent, using the formula: concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, we need to look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of pink particles per milliliter.\n\nAfter analyzing the diagram, it is clear that Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter.

In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change.

    "5812": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets. Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater. There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is A.",

    "5978": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Bleaching clothes is a chemical change. The bleach reacts with dark stains on the clothes. The stains change into different stains. Then the clothes are rinsed to remove the stains. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter. If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily, while a short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. Look at the picture of the hawfinch. The hawfinch has a short, thick beak adapted to crack hard seeds. The hawfinch uses its short, thick beak to press down on a seed and crack open its hard shell.\n\nNext, let's look at each bird to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The Asian golden weaver has a short, thick beak adapted to crack hard seeds. On the other hand, the common swift has a long, thin beak, which is not adapted to crack hard seeds. The common swift uses its beak to drink nectar out of long flowers.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "6186": "Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike. A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other, often using the words \"like\" and \"as.\" For example, \"My sister runs like a cheetah\" compares the sister's running to a cheetah's running using the word \"like,\" implying that the sister runs fast. Another example is \"The cat's fur was as dark as the night,\" where the cat's fur and the night are compared using the word \"as,\" indicating that the cat's fur is dark.\n\nA metaphor, on the other hand, compares two things by saying that one of them is the other, without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"The snow formed a blanket over the town\" compares the snow to a blanket without using \"like\" or \"as,\" suggesting that the snow covers the town completely.\n\nIn the sentence \"On that winter morning, Brittany's hands were as cold as ice,\" the words \"hands\" and \"ice\" are compared using the word \"as.\" Therefore, the sentence uses a simile.\n\nThe answer is B.",

If an organism has at least one dominant allele, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nTo determine the probability that a horse produced by this cross will have a reddish-brown coat, we use a Punnett square. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). The genotypes of the parents are Ll.\n\nThe Punnett square for this cross is:\n | L | l\nL | LL | Ll\nl | Ll | ll\n\nEach box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype for the offspring. There are four possible outcomes: one LL, two Ll, and one ll. The genotypes LL and Ll will result in a black coat, while only the genotype ll will result in a reddish-brown coat.\n\nThere is one box with the genotype ll out of four possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability that a horse produced by this cross will have a reddish-brown coat is 1/4.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "6222": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms, which can be linked together by chemical bonds to form molecules. In a chemical change, these bonds break and the atoms rearrange to form different molecules, resulting in different types of matter before and after the change. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling, while physical changes do not involve breaking chemical bonds and the types of molecules remain the same.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Cooking an egg is also a chemical change because the heat causes the matter in the egg to change, resulting in cooked eggs and raw eggs being made of different types of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes because the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Cooking is caused by heating, but a piece of pizza rotting is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is A.",

A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species.\n\nFor example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws, but Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nA black-tailed jackrabbit's scientific name is Lepus californicus. Sciurus vulgaris does not have the same scientific name as a black-tailed jackrabbit, so Lepus californicus and Sciurus vulgaris are not in the same species. Erinaceus europaeus does not have the same scientific name as a black-tailed jackrabbit, so Lepus californicus and Erinaceus europaeus are not in the same species.

    "6457": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. Use the model to determine whether ethane is an elementary substance or a compound.\n\nStep 1: Interpret the model. Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model. You can see from the model that a molecule of ethane is composed of eight hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms bonded together.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.

    "6504": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed. The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Tammy started sledding. As Tammy rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Tammy rode down the hill. The answer is C.",

    "6779": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies! A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. The answer is C.",

    "7007": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change. When the tablet touches water, the type of matter in the tablet changes and carbon dioxide gas is released. This gas makes the water fizz. Burning food on a stove is a chemical change. When the food burns, the type of matter in it changes. The food turns black and gives off smoke.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

    "7012": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed. The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Julia started sledding. As Julia rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Julia rode down the hill. The answer is C.",

    "7385": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring and contain instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, while its phenotype is the observable version of that trait. For instance, a pea plant's phenotype for flower color can be purple or white.\n\nIn the case of Argo, a horse with a reddish-brown coat, the gene for coat color has two alleles: L for a black coat and l for a reddish-brown coat.

    "7582": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering the question. Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several factors that can make overall supply go up or down. For example, supply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get, when there are more producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go up. Conversely, supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The table below shows how changes to these factors might affect overall supply:\n\n- Supply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get.\n- Supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get.\n- Supply goes up when there are more producers or suppliers.\n- Supply goes down when there are fewer producers or suppliers.\n- Supply goes up when demand is expected to go up.\n- Supply goes down when demand is expected to go down.\n\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.\n\nIn this scenario, four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, reducing the number of suppliers. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the supply of men's shirts probably went down. \n\nThe answer is B.",

    "7892": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust, which is reddish-brown and falls apart easily. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch, which saliva breaks down into a different type of matter that can be digested and absorbed by the body.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

In this food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, we need to determine which organism contains matter that eventually moves to the mushroom.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the paths of matter in the food web. The arrows show the direction of matter movement when one organism eats another. For each answer choice, we need to trace the arrows to see if there is a path leading to the mushroom.\n\nFor the bilberry, there are no arrows pointing from it to any other organisms. Therefore, matter does not move from the bilberry to the mushroom.\n\nFor the brown lemming, there is a path where matter moves from the brown lemming to the earthworm and then to the mushroom.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "8018": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words. The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. A spot-billed pelican's scientific name is Pelecanus philippensis. The first word of its scientific name is Pelecanus. Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.

    "8022": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water. Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "8285": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's phenotype is its observable trait, determined by its genotype. A dominant allele causes its trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. For example, F is dominant over f, so plants with FF or Ff genotypes have purple flowers. Conversely, a recessive allele's trait appears only when no dominant allele is present, so plants with the ff genotype have white flowers.\n\nIn the context of summer squash plants, the gene for leaf texture has two alleles: L for fuzzy leaves (dominant) and ll for smooth leaves (recessive). The plant in question has the genotype ll, meaning it has two recessive alleles. Since the ll allele is recessive and the plant has no dominant L allele, its phenotype will be smooth leaves.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "8321": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Beating an egg is a physical change. The egg changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter as the unbeaten egg. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "8749": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer, separating the water from the sediment. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation. Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change because a change of state does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating, but sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "9104": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown. Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change. The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But using polish to remove tarnish from silver is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "9205": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

    "9389": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.

    "9538": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes have different alleles that can cause different versions of a trait. For instance, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff. The phenotype, or observable trait, depends on the genotype. A dominant allele, like F, will show its trait even if only one copy is present, while a recessive allele, like f, will only show its trait if both alleles are recessive.\n\nIn the context of Moxie, the cow, the gene for coat color has two alleles: L for black coat (dominant) and l for red coat (recessive). Moxie's genotype is LL, meaning she has two dominant alleles. Since the L allele is dominant, Moxie's phenotype will be a black coat.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "9620": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before. Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

If an organism has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it will exhibit the dominant trait. Conversely, if it has only recessive alleles, it will exhibit the recessive trait.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring. The question specifies that the allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). Therefore, a cow with the genotype hh will have horns, while cows with genotypes HH or Hh will not have horns.\n\nConsider the Punnett square:\n | H | h\nH | HH | Hh\nh | Hh | hh\n\nIn this square, there is 1 box with the genotype HH, 2 boxes with the genotype Hh, and 1 box with the genotype hh.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread! Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

    "10476": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter. Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "11006": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again. The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change. Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

The Golgi apparatus, found in both plant and animal cells, packages proteins and other substances and directs them to different parts of the cell. Vacuoles in plant cells are primarily involved in storage and maintaining cell turgor pressure, not in containing the master plan for cell activities and development. Animal cells do not have a nucleus or chloroplasts, and their vacuoles are used for storage and maintaining cell pressure. Given this information, we can analyze the options:\n\n(A) Plant cells can have a nucleus but do not have chloroplasts. This is incorrect because plant cells do have chloroplasts.\n(B) The Golgi packages proteins and other substances and directs them to different parts of a plant cell. This is correct as the Golgi apparatus is responsible for packaging and directing proteins and other substances.\n(C) In an animal cell, the vacuoles contain the master plan for cell activities and cell development. This is incorrect because the master plan for cell activities and development is contained in the nucleus.\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "11191": "There are four kinds of sentences: declarative, imperative, interrogative, and exclamatory. A declarative sentence is a statement and always ends with a period. An imperative sentence makes a request or a demand and usually ends with a period, but if it shows strong feeling, it can end with an exclamation point. An interrogative sentence asks a question and always ends with a question mark. An exclamatory sentence is a statement that shows surprise or strong feeling and always ends with an exclamation point.\n\nThe sentence \"Bridget felt intimidated by the steep cliff that she faced on her first rock-climbing adventure\" is a statement and ends with a period. It does not ask a question, make a request or demand, or show surprise or strong feeling. Therefore, it is a declarative sentence.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Genes may have different alleles that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent. An organism's genotype is its combination of alleles, such as FF, Ff, or ff for flower color. The phenotype is the observable version of the trait, like purple or white flowers.\n\nSome traits are controlled by a single gene, with organisms having two alleles for these traits. These alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous (two identical alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles). The types of alleles in the genotype determine the phenotype. Dominant alleles cause their version of the trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. For instance, F is dominant over f, so a plant with FF or Ff will have purple flowers. Recessive alleles only show their trait if no dominant allele is present, so ff results in white flowers.\n\nIn the context of Cheyenne, the cow, the gene for coat color has two alleles: L for black coat (dominant) and l for red coat (recessive). Cheyenne's genotype is ll, meaning Cheyenne has two recessive alleles. Therefore, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait is a red coat. The answer is B.",

Minerals and rocks have the following properties:\n\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\n\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither. Look closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals.

    "11480": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nFirst, think about each change. Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nNext, look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together. Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger. The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is B.",
    "11758": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.\n\nAfter analyzing the diagram, it is clear that Solution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter. Therefore, their concentrations are the same. The answer is C.",

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not. Both are caused by cooling. Rain is formed when liquid water vapor cools and becomes solid. This is a change of state.

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number and shows what the number means. Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains. There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons. There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton. So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton. Considering these comparisons, the best estimate for the mass of a full box of cereal is 19 ounces. 19 pounds and 19 tons are both too heavy.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is C.",

    "12139": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\n\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets. The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.\n\nDistance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater. There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

    "12399": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter. Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Cooking is caused by heating. But a penny tarnishing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter. Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is A.",
    "12556": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent, and the solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. By using the concentration formula, we can find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.\n\nAfter analyzing the diagram, it is clear that Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles. The answer is B.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. The answer is A.",

The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of the magnetic force can be influenced by the size of the magnets; larger magnets generally exert a greater magnetic force.\n\nIn the given problem, Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, but Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. This difference in size suggests that the magnitude of the magnetic force will be greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. However, the magnets in Pair 1 attract each other, while the magnets in Pair 2 repel each other. The direction of the magnetic force (attraction or repulsion) does not affect its magnitude.\n\nGiven this background, we can analyze the problem: Since Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "12677": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation. Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change as it does not form a different type of matter. Water freezing into ice is a change of state, so it is also a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid, but the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

    "12824": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.

    "12894": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be. The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol. The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula. The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms. You can tell whether gallium arsenide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for gallium arsenide is GaAs. This formula contains two symbols: Ga for gallium and As for arsenic. So, the formula tells you that gallium arsenide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.

For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules. The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change.\n\nWhen an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. Conversely, if the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nIn this case, the submarine dove hundreds of feet from the surface of the ocean toward the ocean floor.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other: At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other. At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other. At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust. Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.\n\nTo figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Cascade Range, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim, and feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The vervet monkey has long fingers and toes, which are adapted for climbing trees. It uses its long fingers and toes to hold on to branches while climbing. \n\nNext, let's look at each animal to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The bare-eared squirrel monkey has long fingers and toes, which are adapted for climbing trees. On the other hand, the lama has four hoofed feet, which are not adapted for climbing trees.

    "13952": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth increases. Conversely, if the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nIn this case, Edgar hiked up a tall mountain to the summit. The summit is higher than the starting point, so the distance between Edgar and the center of Earth increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit. The answer is B.",

The gene for the eye color trait has two alleles: the allele for red eyes (E), which is dominant, and the allele for black eyes (e), which is recessive. \n\nTo determine the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes, we use a Punnett square. The Punnett square for a cross between two heterozygous koi fish (Ee x Ee) is as follows:\n\n | E | e\nE | EE | Ee\ne | Ee | ee\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype EE, 2 boxes with the genotype Ee, and 1 box with the genotype ee. Since the allele for black eyes (e) is recessive, only the genotype ee results in black eyes, while all other genotypes result in red eyes.\n\nTherefore, there are 1 box with the genotype ee (black eyes) and 3 boxes with the genotype EE or Ee (red eyes).

    "14324": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling.

    "14327": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's phenotype is its observable trait, determined by its genotype. A dominant allele causes its trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. For example, F is dominant over f, so plants with FF or Ff genotypes have purple flowers. Conversely, a recessive allele's trait appears only when no dominant allele is present, so plants with the ff genotype have white flowers.\n\nIn the context of cucumber plants, the gene for fruit texture has two alleles: F for bumpy fruit and f for smooth fruit. The plant in question has the genotype FF, meaning it has two dominant alleles for bumpy fruit. Therefore, its phenotype for the fruit texture trait is bumpy fruit.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "14896": "Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space and can come in different states or forms. When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape, meaning it has a size and shape of its own. Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken, such as a piece of paper or a grain of sand.\n\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. A liquid takes the shape of its container but maintains its volume. For example, juice poured from a bottle into a cup still takes up the same amount of space but changes shape.\n\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or shape. A gas expands to fill its container completely and can also be compressed into a smaller space. Many gases are invisible, such as air.\n\nA ruler is a solid because it has a definite size and shape of its own, even though it can be bent. The answer is C.",

    "14941": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter. Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "15596": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering the question. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. Limbs such as arms, legs, flippers, and wings are examples of adaptations that can be specialized for different functions. For instance, long legs might help an animal run fast, flippers might help an animal swim, and wings might help an animal fly.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The context mentions that flamingos live near marshes, rivers, and oceans and eat small crustaceans in shallow water by wading. Their long legs help them keep their bodies above the surface of the water while wading, and thin legs are easier to move through the water.\n\nNext, let's look at each animal to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The great egret has long, thin legs, which are adapted for wading. On the other hand, the African fish eagle has short legs, which are not adapted for wading but for walking on land.\n\nThe answer is B.",

There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton. \n\nNext, let's analyze the problem in detail. One ounce is less than one pound and much less than one ton. For context, a slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton. Given these comparisons, 8 ounces is too light for a full bag of groceries, and 8 tons is far too heavy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best estimate for the mass of a full bag of groceries is 8 pounds.

    "15630": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. \n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth increases. Conversely, if the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nIn this scenario, Caleb rode an escalator from the first floor to the second floor of a shopping mall. The second floor is higher than the first floor, meaning the distance between Caleb and the center of Earth increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and Earth increased as he rode the escalator.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "15794": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust, which is reddish-brown and falls apart easily. Burning food on a stove is a chemical change. When the food burns, the type of matter in it changes, turning black and giving off smoke.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Burning is caused by heating, but rust forming on a metal gate is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before. Loose matter such as sand and small particles of matter such as water are called mixtures. When a mixture is formed, the particles in it are mixed together. But they are not joined together by chemical bonds. So, the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\n\nSediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment makes the water muddy. But both the sediment and the water are still made of the same type of matter as before. This change is a type of separation. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",
    "15810": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. Use the model to determine whether iodine is an elementary substance or a compound.\n\nStep 1: Interpret the model. In the ball-and-stick model shown above, both of the balls are the same color. The legend shows that purple represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol I. So, the model shows you that a molecule of iodine is composed of one chemical element.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound. You know from Step 1 that iodine is composed of only one chemical element. So, iodine is an elementary substance.\n\nThe answer is A.",

Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.\n\nSupply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get, when there are more producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go up. Supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down. Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. The population of Milford fell by 8,000 people. Many of the people who have left are probably trying to sell their houses.

    "16678": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.

This can be corrected by replacing the pronoun with its correct antecedent or rewriting the sentence.\n\nIn the given options, we need to identify which sentence contains a vague pronoun reference. Option (A) states, \"This morning, it said that Megan Williamson won the mayoral election in Belmont,\" Eddie remarked to his sister. Here, the pronoun \"it\" is used without a clear antecedent, making the reference vague. Option (B) states, \"This morning, the newspaper said that Megan Williamson won the mayoral election in Belmont,\" Eddie remarked to his sister. This sentence clearly identifies \"the newspaper\" as the antecedent, avoiding any vagueness.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "16855": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms. You can tell whether silver is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for silver contains one atomic symbol: Ag.

Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction. Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both. The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil. Both parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.\n\nPollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the pistil. Self-pollination occurs when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself, while cross-pollination occurs when pollen from one plant is moved to the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.\n\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs in a process called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant. The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. The question asks what kind of cells sperm are found inside pollen.

The gene for fur texture in Syrian hamsters has two alleles: the dominant allele for straight fur (F) and the recessive allele for wavy fur (f).\n\nFor a hamster to have wavy fur, it must have two recessive alleles (f). Since the allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive, a hamster will only have wavy fur if it has two recessive alleles.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use a Punnett square to determine the probability of different genotypes in the offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible outcome of the cross. For a cross between two heterozygous hamsters (Ff x Ff), the Punnett square looks like this:\n\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we see that there is one box with the genotype Ff (heterozygous for wavy fur).

    "17171": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together, and when they repel, they push apart. These interactions are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude, and the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly they attract or repel each other. The magnitude of a magnetic force can be changed by altering the distance between the magnets. The closer the magnets are to each other, the greater the magnetic force.\n\nIn this problem, we need to compare the magnitude of the magnetic force between two pairs of magnets. The images show that there is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. Since the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the distance between the magnets is smaller, we can conclude that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.\n\nThe answer is C.",

For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nIn this context, the word \"literally\" traditionally means \"in a factual, non-exaggerated way.\" The first text uses \"literally\" in its traditional sense: \"Destiny adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice.

    "17209": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change.

    "17390": "Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals. Minerals and rocks have the following properties: they are solids, formed in nature, not made by organisms, pure substances, and have a fixed crystal structure. You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\n\nLook closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts, so body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too, so substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals. Malachite is a mineral. Gypsum is a mineral. Wool is made by living things. But minerals are not made by living things. Wool is a mixture. But all minerals are pure substances. So, wool is not a mineral.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "17435": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again. The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change. A dinosaur bone turning into rock is a chemical change. Over millions of years, the bone is changed by the rock around it. The rock makes the bone harder and more brittle. So, the bone is not the same type of matter as the rock.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.

    "17611": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water vaporizes and becomes water vapor. But both are made of water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Wax melting is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not. Both are caused by cooling. Rain forms when water vapor cools and becomes liquid. But this is not what happens in the case of melting wax.\n\nThe answer is D.",

For example, \"My friends walk along the path.\" A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma. For instance, \"I knocked on the door it opened.\" or \"It started raining, we ran inside.\" To fix a run-on sentence, you can separate it into two sentences by adding end punctuation after the first sentence and capitalizing the second sentence, such as \"I knocked on the door. It opened.\" or \"It started raining. We ran inside.\" Alternatively, you can rewrite it as a compound sentence by joining the two sentences with a comma and a conjunction like \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or,\" or \"so,\" for example, \"I knocked on the door, and it opened.\" or \"It started raining, so we ran inside.\"\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n(A) \"The explorers nervously entered the dark cave.\" - This is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb, and it forms a complete thought.\n(B) \"Bert borrowed my book he enjoyed it.\" - This is a run-on sentence because it contains two sentences joined without end punctuation: \"Bert borrowed my book\" and \"He enjoyed it.\"\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "17969": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word \"peruse\" once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional usage of \"unique\" means being the only one of its kind. In the first text, \"Pedro custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Oakdale,\" the word \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense because the coffee table is custom-ordered and one of a kind. In the second text, \"Pedro bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Oakdale,\" the word \"unique\" is used in a nontraditional sense, implying that the coffee table is interesting or unusual, but not necessarily one of a kind.\n\nThe answer is A.",

If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down, resulting in less thermal energy and a lower temperature.\n\nIn this problem, the two blocks of concrete are identical in type and mass but differ in temperature. Since the hotter block of concrete has faster-moving atoms, it has more thermal energy. Conversely, the colder block of concrete has slower-moving atoms, resulting in less thermal energy.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "18892": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple. A sidewalk heating up in the sun is a physical change. The temperature of the sidewalk goes up, but the sidewalk is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. Conversely, if the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nIn this scenario, the bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Rose started sledding.

    "19143": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Boiling is caused by heating.

An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. Use the model to determine whether carbon tetrachloride is an elementary substance or a compound.\n\nStep 1: Interpret the model. Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model. You can see from the model that a molecule of carbon tetrachloride is composed of one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms bonded together.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound. You know from Step 1 that carbon tetrachloride is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and chlorine. Since carbon tetrachloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, carbon tetrachloride is a compound.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Minerals and rocks have the following properties:\n\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\n\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither. Look closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat, while a long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The cow has long jaws and flat teeth, which are adapted to eat plant matter. The long jaws help the cow reach grass, and the flat teeth help it cut and grind up the food into soft pieces it can swallow. \n\nNext, let's look at each animal option to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The zebra has long jaws and flat teeth, which are adapted to eat plant matter. On the other hand, the silky anteater has a long tube-shaped mouth and no teeth, which is not adapted to eat plant matter.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown. Making jam is a chemical change. It involves mixing fruit, sugar, and pectin. When these ingredients are mixed and cooked, the chemical bonds in their molecules are broken. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in the original ingredients and in the jam are always different.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes.

Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals.

    "20134": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. A different type of matter is not formed. Bending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Water freezing is caused by cooling. But bending a paper clip is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Therefore, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. A drinking straw is a small object, so it is more reasonable to measure its length in millimeters rather than kilometers or meters. For example, the tip of a pencil is about 1 millimeter wide, and a red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length. Given these comparisons, 25 kilometers, 25 meters, and 25 centimeters are all too long for a drinking straw.\n\nThe best estimate for the length of a drinking straw is 25 millimeters.

    "20382": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Cutting your fingernails is also a physical change. Your fingernails are shorter after you cut them, but the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncut fingernails.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes.

    "20554": "In a group of rose plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: the allele for light yellow flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for dark yellow flowers (f). To determine the probability that a rose plant produced by this cross will have dark yellow flowers, we need to analyze the Punnett square.\n\nFirst, let's consider the genotypes of the parent plants. If both parents are heterozygous (Ff), the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nEach box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype for the offspring. There are four possible outcomes: FF, Ff, Ff, and ff. Since the allele for dark yellow flowers (f) is recessive, only the genotype ff will result in dark yellow flowers.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n- Number of ways to get ff (genotype for dark yellow flowers) = 1\n- Total number of possible outcomes = 4\n\nThe probability that a rose plant produced by this cross will have dark yellow flowers is 1/4.\n\nThe answer is C.",

These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, while its phenotype is the observable version of that trait. For the flower color trait, a pea plant's phenotype can be purple or white flowers, depending on its genotype.\n\nIn the case of cockatiels, the gene for cheek color has two alleles: R for bright orange cheeks and r for pale orange cheeks. Louie has pale orange cheeks, indicating he has two alleles for pale orange cheeks (rr). Therefore, Louie's phenotype for the cheek color trait is pale orange cheeks.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "20815": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight. The sugar is food for the plant. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.

Supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up. \n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Silvergrove. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down. The answer is A.",

    "21206": "A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought and has both a subject and a verb. For example, \"My friends walk along the path\" is a complete sentence. A run-on sentence, on the other hand, is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma, such as \"I knocked on the door it opened\" or \"It started raining, we ran inside.\" To fix a run-on sentence, you can separate it into two sentences by adding end punctuation and capitalizing the second sentence, or by rewriting it as a compound sentence using a comma and a conjunction.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n(A) \"Amy is from Greenwood now she lives in Wildgrove.\" This is a run-on sentence because it contains two complete thoughts without proper punctuation or conjunction.\n(B) \"This book explains the difference between cattle and buffalo.\" This is a complete sentence because it has a subject (\"This book\") and a verb (\"explains\"), forming a complete thought.\n\nThe answer is B."
