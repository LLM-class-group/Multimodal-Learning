    "5": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions about the engineering-design process. The engineering-design process involves developing solutions to problems and includes steps such as defining the problem, doing background research, specifying design requirements, making prototypes, and testing potential solutions to see if they meet the design requirements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. Gordon, an aerospace engineer, was developing a parachute for a spacecraft landing on Mars. He needed to determine the appropriate size of a vent in the parachute to ensure smooth landing at high speeds. To test this, he used a wind tunnel to simulate the parachute moving at 200 km per hour with a 1 m vent and observed how much it swung.\n\nNext, we need to determine what was tested and what was measured. Gordon tested a parachute with a 1 m vent at 200 km per hour. The measurement was how steady the parachute was at that speed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the test measured the steadiness of the parachute at 200 km per hour with a 1 m vent. Therefore, the answer is B.",

Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary and indicate the first and last words on that page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. To find if a word falls between the guide words, we compare the letters of the words alphabetically. If the first letters are the same, we look at the second letters, and so on. If one word is shorter and there are no more letters to compare, the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nIn this case, the guide words are \"daddy\" and \"definition.\" The word \"dozen\" comes after \"daddy\" and before \"definition\" alphabetically.\n\nThe answer is yes.",

In the given food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, we need to determine which organism contains matter that was once part of the lichen.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the food web. Arrows in a food web indicate the direction of matter movement when one organism eats another. For each answer choice, we need to trace the path of arrows to the lichen and then to the given organism.\n\nFor the mushroom, the path is: lichen -> mushroom. There is a direct arrow from the lichen to the mushroom, indicating that the mushroom contains matter that was once part of the lichen.\n\nFor the bilberry, the path is: lichen -> barren-ground caribou -> bilberry. The barren-ground caribou does not have any arrows pointing to it, so matter does not move from the lichen to the bilberry through the barren-ground caribou.\n\nTherefore, the organism that contains matter that was once part of the lichen is the mushroom. The answer is B.",

This type of contradiction is known as an oxymoron, which is a figure of speech that joins two seemingly contradictory terms. Therefore, the answer is B.",
    "29": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and eggshells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter. A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter. If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

To determine the expected ratio of offspring with different fleece types, we can use a Punnett square. \n\nConsider the following Punnett square for a cross between two heterozygous sheep (Ff):\n\n|   | F | f |\n|---|---|---|\n| F | FF | Ff |\n| f | Ff | ff |\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see the following genotypes:\n- FF (hairy fleece) - 1 box\n- Ff (hairy fleece) - 2 boxes\n- ff (woolly fleece) - 1 box\n\nSince the F allele is dominant, both FF and Ff genotypes will result in a hairy fleece, while the ff genotype will result in a woolly fleece. Therefore, there are 3 boxes for a hairy fleece and 1 box for a woolly fleece.\n\nThe expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 1:3. The most likely ratio is D.",

A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Properties can also tell you how an object will behave when something happens to it. Different objects can have properties in common. You can use these properties to put objects into groups. Grouping objects by their properties is called classification. \n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Look at each object. For each object, decide if it has that property. A slippery object is hard to hold onto or stand on. All three objects are slippery. An opaque object does not let light through. The ball of wet clay is opaque, but the other two objects are not. A shiny object reflects a lot of light. The ball of wet clay is shiny, but the other two objects are not.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. The property that all three objects have in common is slippery. The answer is B.",

    "61": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\n\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\n\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\n\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets. The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.\n\nDistance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller. There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is A.",

    "534": "Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms, which are always moving. The energy of these moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up, resulting in more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\n\nWhen the amount of matter changes, such as with two drops of honey, the temperature will be the same if the type of matter and how fast the atoms are moving are the same. In this case, the two drops of honey are made of the same material and have the same amount of matter. Therefore, the drop of honey with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "550": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, such as FF, Ff, or ff for flower color. The phenotype is the observable version of the trait, like purple or white flowers, depending on the genotype. Traits controlled by a single gene have a genotype made up of two alleles, determining whether the organism is homozygous (two identical alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles). Dominant alleles cause their version of the trait to appear even when a recessive allele is present. For example, F is dominant over f, so plants with FF or Ff genotypes have purple flowers. Recessive alleles only show their trait when no dominant allele is present, so plants with the ff genotype have white flowers.\n\nIn the context of jaguars, the gene for the coat pattern has two alleles: A for a black coat and a for a spotted coat. The allele a is recessive to A, meaning a jaguar must have the genotype aa to have a spotted coat. Hari's genotype is aa, so his phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes, which contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits, on the other hand, are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning, while others, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Trevor has a scar on his right arm. To determine if this is an acquired trait, we need to see if it was caused by the environment. Option (A) states that some scars fade more quickly than others, which does not provide information about how Trevor acquired his scar. Option (B) states that Trevor's scar was caused by an accident when he cut his arm falling off his bicycle, which indicates that the scar is an acquired trait caused by the environment.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",

    "1056": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter. Chicken cooking in an oven is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

    "1286": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change because the matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Burning a candle is also a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn, reacting with oxygen in the air and turning into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Burning is caused by heating, but a piece of pizza rotting is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths. Look at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The cougar uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The marmot has large front teeth.

Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is C.\"\n\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies! Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Water evaporating is a physical change.

The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\n\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\n\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

    "1703": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering the question. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. \n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNow, let's analyze the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock, but the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter. Ice melting in a cup is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not created.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Ice melting is caused by heating, but erosion is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "1714": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a particular trait is determined by its genotype. The genotype consists of alleles, which can be either dominant or recessive. The dominant allele will mask the presence of a recessive allele in the phenotype. For the body size trait in rats, the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).\n\nTo determine the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to those with a dwarf body, we need to analyze the Punnett square for a cross between two heterozygous rats (Bb). The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n | B | b\nB | BB | Bb\nb | Bb | bb\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see that there is 1 box with the genotype BB, 2 boxes with the genotype Bb, and 1 box with the genotype bb. The genotypes BB and Bb will result in a normal-sized body because the dominant allele B is present. The genotype bb will result in a dwarf body because it has only recessive alleles.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 boxes representing offspring with a normal-sized body (BB and Bb) and 1 box representing offspring with a dwarf body (bb). The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to those with a dwarf body is 3:1.\n\nThe answer is E.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air.

For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is not having a graying coat.\"\n\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\n\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\n\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\n\nA pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\n\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\n\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\n\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\n\nYou need to determine Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait.

The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg for the coat graying gene. An organism with the genotype gg is homozygous for the coat graying gene. Since the g allele is recessive, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. Arms, legs, flippers, and wings are different types of limbs. The type of limbs an animal has is an example of an adaptation. Animals' limbs can be adapted in different ways. For example, long legs might help an animal run fast. Flippers might help an animal swim. Wings might help an animal fly.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. Gray herons live near marshes, rivers, and lakes. They eat frogs and fish that live in shallow water. Gray herons hunt their prey by walking through water, or wading. The 's legs are adapted for wading. They are lightweight and keep the bird's body above the water.\n\nNext, let's look at each animal to figure out which one has a similar adaptation. The painted stork has long, thin legs. Its legs are adapted for wading. The common kingfisher has short legs. Its legs are not adapted for wading. The common kingfisher uses its legs to walk and perch.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The gene for fur length in Syrian hamsters has two alleles: the dominant allele for short fur (F) and the recessive allele for long fur (f).\n\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a possible genotype for the offspring. Since the allele for short fur (F) is dominant, any genotype with at least one F allele will result in short fur. The genotypes with the recessive allele for long fur (ff) will result in long fur.\n\nGiven the Punnett square for this cross, we can see that there are four possible outcomes:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nThere is one box with the genotype ff, which results in long fur. Therefore, the probability of producing a hamster with long fur (ff) is:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 1 / 4.\n\nThe answer is 1/4.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before and after the change remains the same.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem.

For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\n\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.\n\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.\n\nBy comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.\n\nIn this experiment, Susan investigated whether adding worms to compost containers affects how well food breaks down. The containers that did not get worms serve as a control group. After one month, Susan weighed the amount of undecomposed food left in each container. The containers that got worms were part of an experimental group.

When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape, meaning it has a size and shape of its own. Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken, such as a piece of paper or a grain of sand.\n\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. A liquid takes the shape of its container but maintains its volume. For example, juice poured from a bottle into a cup still takes up the same amount of space but changes shape.\n\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or shape. A gas expands to fill its container and can be compressed into a smaller space. Many gases are invisible, such as air.\n\nA rubber balloon is a gas.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Ice melting in a cup is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid water, but it is still made of water. Dew appearing on grass in the morning is also a change of state, so it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air touches the grass and becomes liquid. The water vapor changes state to become dew, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Ice melting is caused by heating, but dew appearing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Dew appears when water vapor in the air condenses into a liquid on the grass.

    "3385": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering the question. Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. Several factors can influence the overall supply, causing it to go up or down. For instance, supply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get, when there are more producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go up. Conversely, supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. In Fairview, last year there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street, but this year there are only three. This indicates a reduction in the number of suppliers. Since the number of suppliers has decreased, it is likely that the overall supply of men's shirts has also decreased.\n\nIn conclusion, given that the number of men's clothing stores has decreased from seven to three, the supply of men's shirts probably went down. The answer is B.",

When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Dust settling out of the air is also a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

To fix a run-on sentence, you can separate it into two sentences by adding end punctuation and capitalizing the second sentence: \"I knocked on the door. It opened.\" or \"It started raining. We ran inside.\" Alternatively, you can rewrite it as a compound sentence using a comma and a conjunction: \"I knocked on the door, and it opened.\" or \"It started raining, so we ran inside.\"\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n(A) \"We went to Texas we saw an old fort.\" - This is a run-on sentence because it contains two sentences joined without end punctuation: \"We went to Texas\" and \"We saw an old fort.\"\n(B) \"A bag of beans.\" - This is a sentence fragment because it lacks a verb and does not form a complete thought.\n\nThe answer is A.",

The allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f). To determine an organism's phenotype for a trait, look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype. If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele, the phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the trait. If the genotype has only recessive alleles, the phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the trait.\n\nA Punnett square shows the types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\n\nConsider the Punnett square below:\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2. To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The F allele for black fur is dominant over the f allele for brown fur.\n\nBlack fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. Offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff. All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff. Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. Offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff. There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\n\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 4:0. This means that this cross will always produce offspring with black fur and never produce offspring with brown fur. The answer is D.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state, making it a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Stretching a rubber band is also a physical change. The rubber band gets longer, but it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating, but stretching a rubber band is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\n\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\n\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\n\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.

    "4548": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. The rose plant's observable version of the thorns trait is not having thorns. So, the plant's phenotype for the thorns trait is not having thorns.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is not having thorns.",

    "4603": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture, and making a mixture does not form a different type of matter. Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope and the staple are still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change.

    "5475": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same, so the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces, but each piece is still made of paper. Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Bleaching clothes is a chemical change.

    "6212": "In genetics, the phenotype of an organism for a specific trait is determined by its genotype. For the coat color trait in horses, the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means that a horse with at least one L allele will have a black coat, while only a horse with two l alleles will have a reddish-brown coat.\n\nTo determine the probability that a horse produced by this cross will have a reddish-brown coat, we need to analyze the Punnett square for the given cross. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype for the offspring. Since the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive, there must be two copies of this allele for the offspring to have this coat color.\n\nLet's consider the genotypes in the Punnett square:\n- LL (black coat)\n- Ll (black coat)\n- Ll (black coat)\n- ll (reddish-brown coat)\n\nOnly the genotype ll results in a reddish-brown coat color. There is one box with this genotype out of four possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of producing a horse with a reddish-brown coat is:\n\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 1 / 4.\n\nThe answer is 1/4.",

To determine the probability of a rabbit having brown fur, we need to analyze the given Punnett square for a cross between two heterozygous black-furred rabbits (Bb).\n\nThe Punnett square for this cross is:\n | B | b\nB | BB | Bb\nb | Bb | bb\n\nEach box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype of the offspring. The genotypes are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Since brown fur is only possible with the genotype bb, there is only one way for the offspring to have brown fur.\n\nThe probability of an event is calculated as the number of ways the event can happen divided by the total number of equally likely outcomes. In this case, there is 1 way to get the genotype bb out of 4 possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a rabbit produced by this cross will have brown fur is 1/4. The answer is 1/4.",

    "6410": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior, and may have different alleles that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff. The phenotype is the observable trait, such as purple or white flowers, determined by the genotype. Dominant alleles, like F, cause their trait to appear even when paired with a recessive allele, while recessive alleles, like f, only show their trait when paired with another recessive allele.\n\nIn the context of budgerigar parakeets, the body feather color gene has two alleles: B for green body feathers (dominant) and b for blue body feathers (recessive). Chirpie has a heterozygous genotype Bb, meaning Chirpie has one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b). Since the dominant allele (B) causes green body feathers to appear even when paired with a recessive allele (b), Chirpie's phenotype for the body feather color trait is green body feathers. The answer is green body feathers. The answer is B.",

These genes affect observable traits and may have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, while its phenotype is the observable trait. In the case of the Channel catfish, the gene for body color has two alleles: B for brown and b for white. The catfish in question has a brown body, indicating it has at least one B allele. Given that it also has one allele for a white body, the genotype must be Bb.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "6825": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge. An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins. A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene. The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function. An organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. The passage tells you that a certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. This mutation changed the form of the chloride channel protein. The different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that the mutation in the CLCN1 gene affected the structure and function of the chloride channel protein.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change.

This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed. The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Julia started sledding. As Julia rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Julia rode down the hill. The answer is C.",

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion. As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\n\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\n\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.\n\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. Several factors can make overall supply go up or down, such as changes in resources, the number of producers or suppliers, and expected changes in demand.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem in detail. The table below shows how changes to these factors might affect overall supply:\n- Supply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get, when there are more producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go up.\n- Supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down.\n\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services, while suppliers are those who sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly, often increasing supply.\n\nIn this case, four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, reducing the number of suppliers.

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion. As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\n\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\n\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 3 solute particles on the right side of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before.

    "7892": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before and after a change is equal.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase, which breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules in the bread. The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits, on the other hand, are gained during a person's life through learning or environmental factors and are not passed down from parents to offspring.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. The question asks what information supports the conclusion that Rosanne inherited the trait of having wavy hair. Option A states that Rosanne's parents were born with wavy hair and passed down this trait to Rosanne, which directly supports the idea that Rosanne inherited this trait. Option B mentions that Rosanne and her mother both have short hair, which is not relevant to the trait of wavy hair.\n\nThe conclusion is that the information in Option A supports the conclusion that Rosanne inherited the trait of wavy hair.

    "8022": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn, reacting with oxygen in the air and turning into soot, carbon dioxide, and water. Deep-frying chicken is also a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change, making cooked chicken and raw chicken different types of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

In the given excerpt, the writer's use of commas is particularly important. The writer can best improve their grammar and mechanics by using commas correctly. \n\nFor example, the writer uses a comma after \"so\" in the sentence \"When my grandparents first bought a computer, they didn't know how to use the Internet, so I sit down with them and show them the ropes.\" This comma is not necessary as \"so\" is a conjunction that joins two independent clauses. By removing the comma, the sentence becomes: \"When my grandparents first bought a computer, they didn't know how to use the Internet, I sit down with them and show them the ropes.\"\n\nAnother example is the comma usage in the sentence \"I taught them where to find the URL for a website and how to use search boxes.\" The comma after \"taught\" is unnecessary as it is a single-word sentence. The correct sentence is: \"I taught them where to find the URL for a website and how to use search boxes.\"\n\nThe writer can also improve their use of commas in other areas, such as around introductory phrases and with coordinating conjunctions. By reviewing and correcting their comma usage, the writer can significantly improve the grammar and mechanics of their essay.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "8321": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Beating an egg is a physical change.

    "8515": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green. Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. The clay pot gets hot enough to change into a different type of matter. The type of matter before and after firing is always different. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Firing a clay pot is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is D.",

The second sentence, \"Because Katie has a gluten allergy, Kate asked her to make a flourless chocolate cake for their book club meeting,\" clarifies the meaning by specifying that \"she\" refers to Katie.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "8581": "A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought, containing both a subject and a verb. A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma. For example, \"I knocked on the door it opened\" is a run-on sentence because it contains two complete thoughts without proper punctuation.\n\nTo fix a run-on sentence, you can separate it into two sentences by adding end punctuation after the first sentence and capitalizing the second sentence. Alternatively, you can rewrite it as a compound sentence by joining the two sentences with a comma and a conjunction such as \"and,\" \"but,\" or \"so.\"\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n(A) \"The class chuckles at Ms. McKee's joke.\" - This is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb.\n(B) \"Sharon fell asleep Mom put a blanket on her.\" - This is a run-on sentence because it contains two complete thoughts without proper punctuation.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "8749": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change. The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer, separating the water from the sediment. But both the water and the sediment are still made of the same type of matter as before. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation. Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change because a change of state does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating, but sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown. Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change. The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes.

These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's phenotype is its observable trait, determined by its genotype. A dominant allele causes its trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. For example, F is dominant over f, so plants with FF or Ff genotypes have purple flowers. Conversely, a recessive allele's trait appears only when the organism has two recessive alleles, like ff for white flowers.\n\nIn the context of dachshund dogs, the fur texture gene has two alleles: F for rough fur and f for soft fur. Chester has the genotype ff, meaning he has two recessive alleles. Since the f allele is recessive, Chester's phenotype is soft fur. The answer is B.",

They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nNext, a common kestrel's scientific name is Falco tinnunculus. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus. Falco sparverius is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco sparverius and Falco tinnunculus are in the same genus. Tigrisoma mexicanum is in the genus Tigrisoma. The first word of its scientific name is Tigrisoma. So, Tigrisoma mexicanum and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "9475": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms. You can tell whether potassium hydroxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for potassium hydroxide, KOH, contains two atomic symbols: K for potassium and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that potassium hydroxide is composed of two chemical elements: potassium and oxygen. Since potassium hydroxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium hydroxide is a compound. The answer is A.",

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion. As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\n\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\n\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 8 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 4 solute particles on the right side of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.

    "9650": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\n\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\n\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.\n\nThe chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. If a substance is composed of only one chemical element, the chemical formula for the substance contains only one atomic symbol. If a substance is composed of multiple chemical elements, the chemical formula for the substance contains multiple atomic symbols.\n\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms.\n\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical formula for a compound may contain subscripts. A subscript in a chemical formula shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, the formula shows that there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. The subscript 2 shows that the atomic symbol F represents two atoms.\n\nYou can tell whether hydrogen is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for hydrogen is H2. This formula contains one atomic symbol: H. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element.\n\nSubstances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, hydrogen is an elementary substance.\n\nThe answer is B.",

To check if Mars' volume is more than three times that of Mercury's, we calculate three times Mercury's volume: 3 * 6.083 x 10^10 = 1.825 x 10^11 cubic kilometers. Since 1.6318 x 10^11 cubic kilometers (Mars' volume) is less than 1.825 x 10^11 cubic kilometers, the statement is false. The answer is false.",
    "9883": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth increases. Conversely, if the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nIn this case, the whale swam toward the surface of the water. As it swam, the distance between the whale and the center of Earth increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the whale and Earth increased as the whale swam toward the surface. The answer is A.",

    "9891": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional sense of the word \"ironic\" is something that happens in a way that is contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. In the second text, Levi took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather, and in an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week. This situation is ironic because Levi tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.\n\nIn contrast, the first text uses \"ironic\" in a nontraditional sense, marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Levi's friends were in Florida the week before he arrived.\n\nMost style guides recommend avoiding the nontraditional sense of the word \"ironic\" because it is generally considered incorrect.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "10103": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread! Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Melting glass is a physical change. But baking a loaf of bread is not. Both are chemical changes. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. But melting glass is not. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is C.",

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait. If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\n\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\n\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\n\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n\nTo determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.\n\nSweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff. There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\n\nSour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff. There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\n\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 1:3. The answer is 1:3.",

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

    "10476": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter. Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is C.\"\n\nChemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A beaten egg is a chemical change. The egg breaks and the egg white and egg yolk mix together. But they are not the same as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. A puddle freezing into ice is a physical change. But beating an egg is not. Both are chemical changes. A beaten egg is a chemical change. But a puddle freezing into ice is not. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing into ice is caused by cooling. But beating an egg is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "10797": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional usage of \"unique\" means being the only one of its kind. In the first text, \"Jon custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Lancaster,\" the word \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense because the coffee table is custom-ordered and one of a kind. In the second text, \"Jon bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Lancaster,\" the word \"unique\" is used in a nontraditional sense, implying that the coffee table is interesting or unusual, but not necessarily one of a kind.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "11006": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again. The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "11201": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions about genetics. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism and affect its observable traits. Genes may have different alleles that cause different versions of a trait. An organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene, and its phenotype is the observable version of that trait.\n\nIn the context of the fruit flies, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles: the dominant allele for mutated antennae (A) and the recessive allele for normal antennae (a). The Punnett square shows the possible genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two heterozygous flies (Aa x Aa).\n\nTo determine the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae, we need to consider the dominant and recessive alleles. The Punnett square shows the following genotypes:\n | A | a\nA | AA | Aa\na | Aa | aa\n\nThere are 2 boxes with the genotype AA or Aa (mutated antennae) and 2 boxes with the genotype aa (normal antennae). Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 2:2.\n\nThe answer is D.",

In scarlet rosemallow plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for red flowers and f for white flowers. The allele F is dominant over the allele f. \n\nA plant's genotype is its combination of alleles for a gene. The possible genotypes for the flower color gene are FF, Ff, and ff. An organism with two identical alleles (FF or ff) is homozygous, while an organism with two different alleles (Ff) is heterozygous. The phenotype, or observable trait, depends on the genotype. \n\nFor the flower color trait in scarlet rosemallow plants, a plant with at least one F allele (FF or Ff) will have red flowers because F is dominant. A plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers because f is recessive.\n\nGiven that the scarlet rosemallow plant has the homozygous genotype ff, it has two recessive alleles. Since f is recessive and there are no dominant alleles present, the phenotype for this plant's flower color will be white.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "11206": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms. You can tell whether potassium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for potassium chloride, KCl, contains two atomic symbols: K for potassium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that potassium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together. Since potassium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium chloride is a compound. The answer is A.",

    "11480": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nFirst, think about each change. Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change. Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nNext, look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes.

The plateau is over 14,800 feet high and is surrounded by many mountain ranges.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. The question asks which statement describes the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem. Given the characteristics of tundra ecosystems, we know that they have long, cold winters and short, cold summers, soil that is frozen year-round, and mostly small plants.\n\nFinally, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the statement \"It has warm summers and cool winters\" does not describe the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem, as it does not align with the typical climate of tundras. However, the statement \"It has soil that is frozen year-round\" accurately describes a tundra ecosystem.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. The formula for concentration is:\n\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

    "12123": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not. Both are caused by cooling. Rain is formed when water vapor in the air condenses. This is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is A.",

    "12139": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets. The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater. There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C.",

When two organisms of different species interact, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem. A commensal relationship is a symbiotic relationship where one organism benefits while the other is not significantly affected. A mutualistic relationship is a symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit. A parasitic relationship is a symbiotic relationship where one organism benefits while the other is harmed.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the problem. The passage explains that hawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers, and the moth reaches the nectar by putting its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside the flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis. Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar, and pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, pollinating it. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the moth benefits from the nectar it obtains, but the petunia is also significantly affected because it is pollinated and able to reproduce. Therefore, the relationship between the moth and the petunia is mutualistic.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Option A discusses sunglasses, which are unrelated to inherited traits. Option C mentions Lucia's neighbor, who is not a biological relative, so this does not support inheritance. Option B states that Lucia has green eyes like her biological mother, which directly supports the conclusion that Lucia inherited this trait from her mother.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",

To determine whether the magnets will attract or repel, we need to look at the positions of their poles. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south. If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets will attract. If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets will repel.\n\nIn this case, the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Since like poles repel, these magnets will repel each other. The answer is B.",

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\n\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\n\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is B.",

    "12399": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cooking an egg is a chemical change because the heat causes the matter in the egg to change, resulting in cooked eggs and raw eggs being made of different types of matter. Tarnishing of a penny is also a chemical change, as when air touches the penny, the surface changes into a different type of matter, making the penny dull.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, with different types of matter before and after each change. Both are caused by heating. Cooking is caused by heating, but a penny tarnishing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

For example, \"The trees danced in the wind\" describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving.\n\nIn the given sentence, \"The tsunami rushed over the land, () everything in its path,\" we need to choose a word that personifies the tsunami. The word \"devouring\" describes the tsunami as if it were a hungry person, which is an example of personification. Therefore, the correct choice is \"devouring.\"\n\nThe answer is B.",
    "12549": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\n\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\n\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\n\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.\n\nYou can tell whether nitrogen is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for nitrogen is N2. This formula contains one atomic symbol: N. So, the formula tells you that nitrogen is composed of only one chemical element. Since nitrogen is composed of only one chemical element, nitrogen is an elementary substance.\n\nThe answer is B.",

The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nNext, a sand cat's scientific name is Felis margarita.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter. Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But the egg white, egg yolk, and air are still made of the same type of matter as before. Step 2: Look at each answer choice.

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains, and in the metric system, it can be measured in grams or kilograms. There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram, so 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram. For example, a paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. We need to estimate the mass of an elephant. Given the options, 6,370 grams and 6,370 kilograms, we can compare these to typical masses of objects. An elephant is a very large animal, and its mass is much greater than that of smaller objects like paper clips or textbooks. Therefore, 6,370 grams is too light for an elephant.\n\nFinally, considering the typical mass of an elephant, which is usually measured in thousands of kilograms, the better estimate for the mass of an elephant is 6,370 kilograms.

    "12824": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be. The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol. The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula. The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms. You can tell whether gallium arsenide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula with only one symbol. A compound is represented by a chemical formula with multiple symbols.

Organisms make their own body parts, so body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too, so substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals.

    "13007": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Your saliva breaks the bread down into a soft, sticky substance. This substance is called a bolus. The bolus can be swallowed and then digested in the stomach.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "13202": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering the question. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily, while a short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. The Allen's hummingbird has a long, thin beak adapted to get nectar out of long flowers. This beak shape allows it to reach deep into flowers to access nectar. To solve the problem, we need to identify which bird has a similar adaptation.\n\nThe green violetear has a long, thin beak adapted to get nectar out of long flowers, similar to the Allen's hummingbird.

    "13204": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other: At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other. At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other. At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other. One type of convergent boundary is an ocean-continent subduction zone, which forms when a plate with oceanic crust and a plate with continental crust move toward each other. The oceanic crust subducts, or sinks, below the continental crust. As the oceanic crust subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes called a volcanic arc.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Cascade Range, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully. The Cascade Range is a volcanic arc in the Pacific Northwest that begins in California and runs north into British Columbia. As the North American Plate and the Juan de Fuca Plate move toward each other, oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts, or sinks, below continental crust of the North American Plate. There are eighteen volcanoes in the Cascade Range, and some of them are still active. Mount St. Helens is an active volcano near Seattle, Washington. It last erupted in May of 1980.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. The underlined part of the passage explains that the Cascade Range formed as the two plates moved toward each other. The answer is convergent. The answer is C.",
    "13210": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same, so the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Getting a haircut is a physical change. Your hair is shorter after a haircut, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log gets shorter, but it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut log.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "13420": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be. The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol. The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula. The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms. You can tell whether lithium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for lithium bromide is LiBr. This formula contains two symbols: Li for lithium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that lithium bromide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. The answer is A.",

The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits. A genus is made up of one or more species. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus. Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example, Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus, but they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus, and Ursus americanus has the species name americanus. Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur, and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. An agile wallaby's scientific name is Macropus agilis.

Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is B.\"\n\nIn a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion. As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\n\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\n\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 3 solute particles on the right side of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before. So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.\n\nThe answer is B.",

When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape, meaning it has a size and shape of its own. Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken, such as a piece of paper or a grain of sand.\n\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. A liquid takes the shape of its container but maintains its volume. For example, juice poured from a bottle into a cup still takes up the same amount of space but changes shape.\n\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or shape. A gas expands to fill its container completely and can also be compressed into a smaller space. Many gases are invisible, such as air.\n\nFruit punch is a liquid because it takes the shape of its container. If you pour fruit punch into a different container, it will take the shape of that container but still occupy the same amount of space.\n\nThe answer is B.",

    "14324": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",
    "14327": "Genes are pieces of hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, containing instructions for building parts of an organism. These genes affect observable traits, including appearance and behavior. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that cause different versions of a trait. For example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff.\n\nAn organism's phenotype is its observable trait, determined by its genotype. A dominant allele causes its trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. For example, F is dominant over f, so plants with FF or Ff genotypes have purple flowers. Conversely, a recessive allele's trait appears only when the organism has two recessive alleles, like ff for white flowers.\n\nIn the context of cucumber plants, the gene for fruit texture has two alleles: F for bumpy fruit and f for smooth fruit. The plant in question has the genotype FF, meaning it has two dominant alleles for bumpy fruit. Therefore, the plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait is bumpy fruit.\n\nThe answer is A.",

    "14605": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge. People can't make it to Mars yet because it takes too long to get there and it's not an easy place to live. Scientists sent a robot named Curiosity to look around Mars for them. Curiosity has many cameras and takes pictures as it moves around Mars, sending the pictures back to scientists on Earth. The purpose of this is to make it easier for people to visit Mars someday.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem. The passage mentions that it takes too long to get to Mars, which is one reason people can't go there. The passage also mentions that it's not an easy place to live, which implies that the conditions on Mars are harsh.\n\nFinally, let's conclude. Given that the main reasons people can't go to Mars are the long travel time and the harsh conditions, we can determine that the correct answer is A.\n\nThe answer is A.",
    "14607": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. Scientists use different types of atomic symbols to represent chemical elements. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\n\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\n\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer. You can tell whether sodium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for sodium bromide, NaBr, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that sodium bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together. Since sodium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium bromide is a compound. The answer is A.",

    "14648": "This is a choice question. First, let's introduce some background knowledge related to answering the question. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors. The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim, while feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem. Look at the picture of the brown bear. The brown bear has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice. The fur can help keep the brown bear's feet warm, and the large pads help spread its weight over a larger area. This allows it to walk on ice without slipping and to walk on snow without sinking in too deep.\n\nNow, let's look at each animal. The Eurasian lynx has furry feet with large pads, which are adapted to walk on snow and ice. On the other hand, the Suriname toad has wide, sticky toes, which are not adapted to walk on snow and ice. The Suriname toad uses its toes to climb trees and walk on leaves.\n\nThe answer is A.",

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air.

    "15382": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed. Ice melting in a glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Both changes are caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Step 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter. Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter. Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before and after the change is equal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. Tarnishing, such as a penny tarnishing, is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter, making the penny dull. In this case, the penny and the air react to form a different type of matter called tarnish. The process of turning a dinosaur bone into rock over millions of years is also a chemical change.

    "16855": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula. An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol. The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule. For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms. A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols. The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula. For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms. You can tell whether silver is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters. The chemical formula for silver contains one atomic symbol: Ag. So, the formula tells you that silver is composed of only one chemical element. Since silver is composed of only one chemical element, silver is an elementary substance. The answer is A.",

Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. The answer is B.",
    "17176": "This is a choice question. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several factors that can make overall supply go up or down. For example, supply goes up when resources cost less or are easier to get, when there are more producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go up. Conversely, supply goes down when resources cost more or are harder to get, when there are fewer producers or suppliers, or when demand is expected to go down.\n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. Newport's cough drop factories were destroyed by floods. This means that the number of producers of cough drops in Newport has gone down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",

    "17209": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change.

Minerals and rocks have the following properties: they are solids, formed in nature, not made by organisms, pure substances, and have a fixed crystal structure. You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\n\nLook closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts, so body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too, so substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals.

    "17435": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years is a chemical change. The bone gets hard and brittle. It is no longer a dinosaur bone. The molecules in the bone change into different molecules that make up the rock. A dinosaur bone is made of matter. A rock is also made of matter. But the type of matter in a rock is different from the type of matter in a dinosaur bone. A dinosaur bone turning into a rock is a chemical change. A dinosaur bone is a type of fossil. Fossils are the remains of organisms that lived long ago. When a fossil forms, the molecules in the organism's body get into the fossil. The molecules in the fossilized organism's body are different from the molecules in the organism's body when it was alive. So, a fossil is a chemical change. A fossil is a type of chemical change. Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change. The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a chemical change.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating.

    "17611": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Melting wax is a change of state, so it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid but remains the same type of matter. Rain forming in a cloud is also a change of state, so it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water, but a different type of matter is not formed.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Wax melting is caused by heating, but rain forming in a cloud is not. Both are caused by cooling. Rain forms when water vapor in the air cools, but melting wax is not caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "17969": "Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner. When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\n\nThe traditional usage of \"unique\" means being the only one of its kind. In the first text, Pedro custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Oakdale. This implies that the coffee table is one of a kind, making it unique in its traditional sense. In the second text, Pedro bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Oakdale.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation. Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change because a change of state does not form a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating.

Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.\n\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms and the sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Different colors of balls represent different elements, as shown in the legend. The element that is represented by a color is called the chemical element of that element. The chemical formula for a substance contains the chemical formula for each chemical element in the substance. The subscript after a symbol in a chemical formula tells you how many atoms of that element the symbol represents.\n\nSo, for example, in the chemical formula H2O, the symbol H represents two hydrogen atoms, and the symbol O represents one oxygen atom. The subscripts after the symbols indicate that there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in the molecule.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given problem.

    "18550": "In a group of sheep, the gene for wool color has two alleles: the allele for white wool (L) is dominant over the allele for black wool (l). To determine the probability that a sheep produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant (LL) for the wool color gene, we use a Punnett square.\n\nA Punnett square helps us visualize the possible genotypes of the offspring. Each box in the Punnett square represents a possible genotype of the offspring, and each box is equally likely. For a cross between two heterozygous sheep (Ll x Ll), the Punnett square is as follows:\n\n | L | l\nL | LL | Ll\nl | Ll | ll\n\nThere are four possible outcomes: LL, Ll, Ll, and ll. The probability of producing a homozygous dominant (LL) offspring is the number of LL outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 1. The probability of producing a homozygous recessive (ll) offspring is the number of ll outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 1.\n\nGiven that both parents are heterozygous (Ll), there is one box with the genotype LL and two boxes with the genotype Ll. Therefore, the probability that a sheep produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the wool color gene is 1/4.\n\nThe answer is 1/4.",

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. The total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. Cutting an apple is a physical change.

    "19143": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. Boiling sugar to make caramel is also a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter, which is brown and sticky.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes, and the type of matter before and after each change is different.

    "19227": "In genetics, an organism's phenotype for a trait is determined by its genotype, which consists of alleles. Some alleles are dominant, while others are recessive. If an organism has at least one dominant allele, the dominant trait will be expressed. If it has only recessive alleles, the recessive trait will be expressed.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring. The question specifies that the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles: A (dominant, solid coloring) and a (recessive, white spots). \n\nConsider the Punnett square for the cross between two heterozygous cows (Aa x Aa):\n | A | a\nA | AA | Aa\na | Aa | aa\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype AA, 2 boxes with the genotype Aa, and 1 box with the genotype aa. This means there are 3 boxes with at least one dominant allele (A) and 1 box with two recessive alleles (aa).\n\nTherefore, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 1:3. The most likely ratio is 2:2, but since this is not possible with the given genotypes, we choose the closest reasonable ratio.\n\nThe answer is B.",

Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. Last, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: \"The answer is A.\"\n\nAll organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\n\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\n\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene. An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\n\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\n\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\n\nYou need to determine Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait. First, introduce some background knowledge related to answering questions and conduct a detailed analysis of the problem. Next, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem.

    "19879": "Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces. Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S). Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles. If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other. The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other. The answer is A.",

To help describe these interactions, ecologists use specific terms for different types of groups. A single organism is an individual. Individuals of the same species that live in the same place are part of a population. Multiple populations of different species that live in the same place are part of a community. Together, communities of living organisms and the nonliving parts of their environment make up an ecosystem.\n\nTo determine which option best describes a community in the Southern Ocean, we need to identify the living organisms that interact with each other in this environment. Option A includes nonliving components (algae, sea ice, and seawater), which do not form a community. Option B includes both living (Antarctic krill, emperor penguins, and leopard seals) and nonliving components, making it incorrect. Option C describes a pod of humpback whales, which is a single population rather than a community.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of a community in the Southern Ocean is a group of living organisms that interact with each other in the same place. This includes the algae, the sea ice, and the seawater. The answer is A.",

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned. Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring. \n\nNext, analyze in detail the process of solving the problem. The question asks which information supports the conclusion that Austin inherited his hazel eyes. Option A mentions that Austin and his sisters wear glasses, which is an acquired trait and not related to eye color inheritance. Option C states that Austin's friend has hazel eyes, but friends are not biologically related, so this does not support inheritance. Option B mentions that Austin's biological father has hazel eyes, which directly supports the idea that Austin inherited this trait from his father.\n\nLast, give a conclusion and finally give your answer by outputting: The answer is B.",

This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. \n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth increases. Conversely, if the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. If the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nIn this case, Herman hiked up a tall mountain to the summit. The summit is higher than the starting point, so the distance between Herman and the center of Earth increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Herman and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit. The answer is A.",

    "20134": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from liquid to solid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water. Bending a paper clip is a physical change. The paper clip gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Water freezing is caused by cooling. But bending a paper clip is not.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "20268": "Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals. Minerals and rocks have the following properties: they are solids, formed in nature, not made by organisms, pure substances, and have a fixed crystal structure. You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\n\nLook closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!\n\nCompare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals. A shark's tooth is a mineral. It is a pure substance. It is a solid. And it is not made by living things. Chalcopyrite is a mineral. It is a pure substance. It is a solid. And it is not made by living things. Quartz is a mineral. It is a pure substance. It is a solid. And it is not made by living things.

The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). To determine the probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks, we need to analyze the Punnett square.\n\nA Punnett square shows the possible genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two parents. Each box in the Punnett square represents a different genotype, and each of the four outcomes is equally likely. For example, if we cross two heterozygous parents (Rr x Rr), the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n | R | r\nR | RR | Rr\nr | Rr | rr\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see that there are three boxes with the genotype RR or Rr (bright orange cheeks) and one box with the genotype rr (pale orange cheeks). Therefore, the probability of an offspring having bright orange cheeks is:\n\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 3 / 4.\n\nThe answer is 3/4.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles. If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other. The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other. The answer is A.",

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, but ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before and after the change remains the same.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem. Photosynthesis is a chemical change where plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight. A penny tarnishing is also a chemical change where the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter, making the penny dull. Neither change is caused by heating or cooling.\n\nNext, let's look at each answer choice:\n- Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes.\n- Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, as the type of matter before and after each change is different.\n- Both are caused by heating: Neither change is caused by heating.\n- Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C.",

    "21135": "A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, they are called opposing forces. When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object. When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.\n\nTo determine if there is a net force on Kimi, look at the forces: Earth's gravity is pulling Kimi down with a force of 600 N. The seat of the cart is pushing Kimi up with a force of 1,200 N. The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi. The answer is A.",
    "21136": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger. The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is A.",

    "21146": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies! Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Baking is caused by heating. But rust forming on a metal gate is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D.",

    "21153": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. For every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. \n\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases. When the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stays the same.\n\nThink about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed. Dale was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Dale, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Dale. \n\nThe answer is A.",
