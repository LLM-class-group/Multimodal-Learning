Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nTom placed a ping pong ball in a catapult, pulled the catapult's arm back to a 45° angle, and launched the ball. Then, Tom launched another ping pong ball, this time pulling the catapult's arm back to a 30° angle. With each launch, his friend Justin measured the distance between the catapult and the place where the ball hit the ground. Tom and Justin repeated the launches with ping pong balls in four more identical catapults. They compared the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 45° angle to the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 30° angle.\nFigure: a catapult for launching ping pong balls.\nOptions: (A) Do ping pong balls stop rolling along the ground sooner after being launched from a 30° angle or a 45° angle? (B) Do ping pong balls travel farther when launched from a 30° angle compared to a 45° angle?\n<image>"

Logistic growth, in contrast, occurs when resources are scarce or a population faces considerable limiting factors, such as predators.

One day, she noticed tumor-like growths on her rose stems. She could tell that the plants had crown gall disease, which is caused by a type of bacteria. She knew that allicin, a chemical in garlic, can kill bacteria. Mia wondered if spraying her plants with garlic juice would prevent more tumors from forming on her plants.\nOnce a day, Mia sprayed garlic juice on ten infected plants and left another 10 infected plants unsprayed. After one month, she compared the number of new tumors on plants in the two groups.\nFigure: crown gall tumors on a rose stem.\nOptions: (A) the roses that were not sprayed (B) the roses sprayed with garlic juice\n<image>"

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKevin was a mechanical engineer who was designing to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Kevin wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nOptions: (A) if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50°C (B) how well the weather station would work when it was windy\n<image>"

It caught on briefly, and many people worked to refine its design. In 1863, pedals were added. A few years later, a new, lighter bike was developed that used a very large front wheel and a small rear wheel. Called the \"Ariel,\" it became popular but was quite accident-prone.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nScott was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Scott put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\n<image>"

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nAaron was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Aaron thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design.\nOptions: (A) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area (B) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design (C) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road\n<image>"

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nEllie was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Ellie wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Ellie put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nOptions: (A) if the blade guards would break in a crash (B) if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly (C) how much the drone weighed with the blade guards\n<image>"

She added one ripe banana to two of the bags and no bananas to the remaining two bags. Then, Katy sealed all four bags. After three days, she opened each bag and counted the number of ripe in each bag.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Mark wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nOptions: (A) how well the weather station would work when it was windy (B) if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50°C\n<image>"

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nOwen was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Owen put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\n<image>"

The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nOptions: (A) They are shy animals that usually hide in tall grass. (B) They are wild guinea pigs that live in mountain forests. (C) They are the closest relatives of the hippopotamus. (D) They are large rodents that are powerful swimmers.\n<image>"
