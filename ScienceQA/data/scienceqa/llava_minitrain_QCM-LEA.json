Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nTom placed a ping pong ball in a catapult, pulled the catapult's arm back to a 45\u00b0 angle, and launched the ball. Then, Tom launched another ping pong ball, this time pulling the catapult's arm back to a 30\u00b0 angle. With each launch, his friend Justin measured the distance between the catapult and the place where the ball hit the ground. Tom and Justin repeated the launches with ping pong balls in four more identical catapults. They compared the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 45\u00b0 angle to the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 30\u00b0 angle.\nFigure: a catapult for launching ping pong balls.\nOptions: (A) Do ping pong balls stop rolling along the ground sooner after being launched from a 30\u00b0 angle or a 45\u00b0 angle?

The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a hairy body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a hairless body.\nA hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait.

For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n A Victoria crowned pigeon's scientific name is Goura victoria. The first word of its scientific name is Goura.\nGoura scheepmakeri is in the genus Goura. The first word of its scientific name is Goura. So, Goura scheepmakeri and Goura victoria are in the same genus.\nAequorea victoria and Goura victoria are not in the same genus.\nThese organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Aequorea victoria and Goura victoria have the same species name within their genus, victoria. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Aequorea victoria is in the genus Aequorea, and Goura victoria is in the genus Goura.\nFalco sparverius is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco sparverius and Goura victoria are not in the same genus. The answer is A."

The volume of Jupiter is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 8.27 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than ten times as large as Saturn's volume. The answer is B."

The lionesses work together to feed and protect all the cubs for about two years.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Lionesses have to protect their cubs from male lions that are not part of their pride. These male lions may attack and kill the cubs to try to take over the pride. When a pride has multiple lionesses, the cubs are less likely to be killed in an attack. When a pride has only one lioness, the cubs are more likely to be killed.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Choice \"Raising cubs with other lionesses in a pride increases the chances that the lioness's cubs will survive attacks.\" is incorrect.\" is correct.\nChoice \"According to the underlined text, cubs are more likely to survive attacks by male lions when a pride has multiple lionesses. So, by raising cubs with other lionesses in a pride, a lioness increases the chances that her cubs will survive. This can increase her reproductive success.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Choice \"Raising cubs with other lionesses in a pride increases the chances that the lioness's cubs will be around other cubs.\" is incorrect.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Raising cubs with other lionesses in a pride may increase the chances that the lioness's cubs will be around other cubs. But the passage does not discuss whether this could affect the lioness's reproductive success. If more cubs are in a pride, they may compete for food. If the lioness's cubs have trouble getting food, that could decrease her reproductive success.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Choice \"Raising cubs with other lionesses in a pride increases the chances that the lioness will feed the cubs of other lionesses.\" is incorrect.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"To increase her reproductive success, the lioness needs to have offspring that survive to reproduce. Feeding the cubs of other lionesses does not directly increase the lioness's chances of producing offspring that survive to reproduce. So, feeding other cubs of other lionesses is not why raising cubs with other lionesses increases the lioness's reproductive success.\" is incorrect. The answer is B."

To test this idea, Sanjay headed to the sledding hill near his house on a cold winter morning.\nWhen he got to the hill, the temperature outside was 16\u00b0F. Starting from the top of the hill, Sanjay rode straight down the hill three times. For each ride, he measured the distance he traveled across the flat field at the bottom of the hill. Then, Sanjay waited until mid-afternoon, when the temperature outside had increased to 43\u00b0F.

One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed. Look at the distance each speedboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each speedboat moved does not affect its speed.\nNotice that each speedboat moved for 10 hours. The speedboat that moved 955 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that speedboat must have moved at the lowest speed. The answer is C."

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!

The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nA crayon melting in the sun is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The crayon changes state from solid to liquid. The crayon is still made of wax, even after it melts.\nA puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nA crayon melting in the sun is caused by heating.

When a population inhabits an environment with abundant resources and few limiting factors, it can experience exponential growth. Under these conditions, a population grows increasingly rapidly. Plotted on a graph with time on the x-axis and population size on the y-axis, exponential growth resembles a J-shaped curve. Logistic growth, in contrast, occurs when resources are scarce or a population faces considerable limiting factors, such as predators. Logistic growth resembles an S-shaped curve: it rises steeply at first but then levels off.

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. Mickey's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Mickey's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for brown fur. So, Mickey's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Mickey's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nMickey's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Mickey's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur. The answer is B."

The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species.

For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter.

A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms. Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for boron trichloride contains two symbols: B for boron and Cl for chlorine. So, boron trichloride is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, boron trichloride is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for benzene contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, benzene is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Slim's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairless body. So, Slim's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body. The answer is A."

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nMolding clay into the shape of a pot is a physical change. The clay gets a different shape. But it is made of the same type of matter.\nShaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling. The answer is C."

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. You need to determine the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the stem height gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a short stem (h) is recessive to the allele for a tall stem (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nThe pea plant's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a tall stem.

Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. \nBecause there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff.

It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.\nMagnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show?

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds. The answer is B."

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. You need to determine Cotton's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Cotton's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nCotton's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Cotton's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur. The answer is B."

Conifers use their cones for sexual reproduction.\nMost conifer trees have both male and female cones. The male cones produce pollen. The female cones produce eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the cone.\nMale cones release pollen into the wind. Pollination happens when pollen lands on and sticks to the female cones. Self-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on the same tree. Cross-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on a different tree.\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs at the base of the female cone's scales. This is called fertilization.\nThe fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures. They can be carried long distances by the wind. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.\nThe new plant can grow cones and begin the conifer life cycle again. Pine seeds can be dispersed, or spread around, by the wind. When the seeds land on the ground, they can germinate and grow into a new plant.\nPollen may land on and stick to an unfertilized female cone. But seeds are not dispersed by sticking to female cones.

A few years later, a new, lighter bike was developed that used a very large front wheel and a small rear wheel. Called the \"Ariel,\" it became popular but was quite accident-prone.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nA piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.\nBurning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nBurning is caused by heating.

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit sheen gene is ff. The cucumber plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for glossy fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be glossy fruit.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe cucumber plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be glossy fruit.

                "value": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nStretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.\nWater evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nWater evaporating is caused by heating. But stretching a rubber band is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling. The answer is D."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nScott was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Scott put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\n<image>"

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. Walker's genotype for the horns gene is hh. Walker's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for having horns. So, Walker's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Walker's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nWalker's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Walker's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns. The answer is A."

                "value": "Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n A barn owl's scientific name is Tyto alba. The first word of its scientific name is Tyto.\nArdea alba and Tyto alba are not in the same genus.\nThese organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ardea alba and Tyto alba have the same species name within their genus, alba. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ardea alba is in the genus Ardea, and Tyto alba is in the genus Tyto.\nAcanthaster planci is in the genus Acanthaster. The first word of its scientific name is Acanthaster. So, Acanthaster planci and Tyto alba are not in the same genus.\nThis organism and the barn owl are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Tyto alba.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nA sidewalk heating up in the sun is a physical change. The temperature of the sidewalk goes up, but the sidewalk is still made of the same type of matter.\nA puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nA sidewalk getting warm in the sun is caused by heating.

Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules.

In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.\nUse the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.\nSolution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles. The answer is A."

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nA banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter.\nMixing glue and laundry powder to create putty is a chemical change.

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. The Channel catfish's genotype for the body color gene is bb. The Channel catfish's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a white body. So, the Channel catfish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a white body.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the Channel catfish's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a brown body (B) is dominant over the allele for a white body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nThe Channel catfish's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the Channel catfish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a white body. The answer is A."

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. The rose plant's genotype for the flower form gene is ff. The rose plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for single flowers. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the flower form trait must be single flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for single flowers (f) is recessive to the allele for double flowers (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe rose plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the flower form trait must be single flowers. The answer is A."

                "value": "Gymnosperms are plants that have seeds but not flowers. Conifers are a type of a gymnosperm. Instead of flowers, conifers have cones. Conifers use their cones for sexual reproduction.\nMost conifer trees have both male and female cones. The male cones produce pollen. The female cones produce eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the cone.\nMale cones release pollen into the wind. Pollination happens when pollen lands on and sticks to the female cones. Self-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on the same tree. Cross-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on a different tree.\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs at the base of the female cone's scales. This is called fertilization.\nThe fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures. They can be carried long distances by the wind. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.\nThe new plant can grow cones and begin the conifer life cycle again. A pine tree's cones make seeds. Sperm from pollen fuses with an egg inside the female cone. This is called fertilization. The fertilized egg grows into a seed.\nA pine tree's needles are its leaves! The needles make most of the food for the tree using photosynthesis. They do not make the seeds. The answer is B."

Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms. You can tell whether dichloromethane is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for dichloromethane, CH2 Cl2, contains three atomic symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that dichloromethane is composed of three chemical elements bonded together.\nSince dichloromethane is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, dichloromethane is a compound. The answer is B."

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nPhotosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.\nCooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nCooking is caused by heating. But photosynthesis is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling. The answer is B."

However, the government doesn't need proof of a crime before searching someone. The government just has to have a good reason to believe a crime has taken place.

For example, the person might be acting in a suspicious or strange way. Or a police officer might see something against the law before the search.

How can a police officer or other member of the government get the right to search someone? The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. The rose plant's genotype for the flower form gene is FF. The rose plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for double flowers. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the flower form trait must be double flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for double flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for single flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe rose plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the flower form trait must be double flowers. The answer is A."

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have Bekko patterning, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the Bekko patterning trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for having Bekko patterning, is dominant over the b allele, which is for not having Bekko patterning.\nNot having Bekko patterning is the recessive allele's version of the Bekko patterning trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the Bekko patterning trait must have only recessive alleles for the Bekko patterning gene. So, offspring that do not have Bekko patterning must have the genotype bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype bb.\nHaving Bekko patterning is the dominant allele's version of the Bekko patterning trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the Bekko patterning trait must have at least one dominant allele for the Bekko patterning gene. So, offspring that have Bekko patterning must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Bekko patterning to offspring that have Bekko patterning is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that do not have Bekko patterning. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that have Bekko patterning.

Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nThe shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks. Look at the picture of the European robin.\nA short, thin beak is light and easy to move. The European robin uses its beak to grab fast-moving insects while flying.\nNow look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.\nThe European nightjar has a short, thin beak.

The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Mark wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind.

The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nOptions: (A) how well the weather station would work when it was windy (B) if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C\n<image>"

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds. The answer is B."

This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.\nBy comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height. In this experiment, Jayden investigated whether adding earthworms to soil affects how many leaves grow on mint plants. So, the mint plants that got earthworms were part of an experimental group.\nThere were no earthworms in the soil of the mint plants that did not get earthworms.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nCooking chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.\nMetal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes.

                "value": "All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers. Dasher's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Dasher's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a red coat. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Dasher's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nDasher's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat. The answer is B."

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have agouti fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the agouti fur trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for not having agouti fur, is recessive to the A allele, which is for having agouti fur.\nHaving agouti fur is the dominant allele's version of the agouti fur trait. A cat with the dominant version of the agouti fur trait must have at least one dominant allele for the agouti fur gene. So, offspring that have agouti fur must have the genotype AA or Aa.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.\nNot having agouti fur is the recessive allele's version of the agouti fur trait. A cat with the recessive version of the agouti fur trait must have only recessive alleles for the agouti fur gene. So, offspring that do not have agouti fur must have the genotype aa.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that have agouti fur to offspring that do not have agouti fur is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that have agouti fur. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that do not have agouti fur.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nOwen was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Owen put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\n<image>"

Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

It has a backbone.\nA castor bean tick is an insect. Like other insects, a castor bean tick is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.\nLike other spiders, a black widow spider is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton. The answer is A."

Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.\nFossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.\nThe relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers. Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.\nCompare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:\nThe feather fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the insect fossil. So, the feather fossil is most likely older than the insect fossil. The answer is A."

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nBaking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies!\nBurning a marshmallow is a chemical change.

The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nOptions: (A) They are shy animals that usually hide in tall grass. (B) They are wild guinea pigs that live in mountain forests.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.

In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nLoki's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele.

Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 8 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 4 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.\nWhen the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.\nLines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0\u00b0 longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.\nThe equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180\u00b0E and 180\u00b0W.\nTogether, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place. The equator is the line at 0\u00b0 latitude. It intersects Asia. It does not intersect Antarctica or North America. The answer is A."

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nShaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\nMixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling. The answer is B."

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change.\nPicking up a paper clip with a magnet is a physical change. The paper clip sticks to the magnet, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\nBreaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling. The answer is C."

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Henry's observable version of the leg color trait is yellow legs. So, Henry's phenotype for the leg color trait is yellow legs. The answer is A."
