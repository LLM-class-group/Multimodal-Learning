Then, Tom launched another ping pong ball, this time pulling the catapult's arm back to a 30\u00b0 angle. With each launch, his friend Justin measured the distance between the catapult and the place where the ball hit the ground. Tom and Justin repeated the launches with ping pong balls in four more identical catapults. They compared the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 45\u00b0 angle to the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 30\u00b0 angle.\nFigure: a catapult for launching ping pong balls.\nOptions: (A) Do ping pong balls stop rolling along the ground sooner after being launched from a 30\u00b0 angle or a 45\u00b0 angle?

To identify the question an experiment can answer, you need to determine what was tested and what was measured. \n\nIn Tom and Justin's experiment, they launched ping pong balls from a catapult at two different angles (30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0) and measured the distances the balls traveled. The variable tested was the launch angle, and the outcome measured was the distance traveled by the ping pong balls.\n\nThe experiment can answer questions about how the launch angle affects the distance traveled by the ping pong balls. Therefore, the question that Tom and Justin's experiment can best answer is whether ping pong balls travel farther when launched from a 30\u00b0 angle compared to a 45\u00b0 angle.\n\nThe answer is B."

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you. A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds. Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be. Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents the compound pyrite. In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. Use the model to determine whether tungsten carbide is an elementary substance or a compound.\n\nStep 1: Interpret the model. Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model. You can see from the model that tungsten carbide is composed of carbon atoms and tungsten atoms bonded together.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound. You know from Step 1 that tungsten carbide is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and tungsten. Since tungsten carbide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, tungsten carbide is a compound.\n\nThe answer is B."

In genetics, the phenotype of an organism is determined by its genotype, which consists of alleles that can be either dominant or recessive. For the body hair trait in deer mice, the allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). Therefore, an organism with at least one dominant allele (BB or Bb) will have a hairy body, while only those with two recessive alleles (bb) will have a hairless body.\n\nTo solve the problem, we use a Punnett square to predict the genotypes of the offspring from a cross between two heterozygous deer mice (Bb x Bb). The Punnett square is as follows:\n | B | b\nB | BB | Bb\nb | Bb | bb\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we see that there is 1 box with the genotype BB, 2 boxes with the genotype Bb, and 1 box with the genotype bb. This results in the following phenotypic ratio:\n- Hairy body (BB or Bb): 3 boxes\n- Hairless body (bb): 1 box\n\nTherefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to those with a hairless body is 3:1.

Similarly, a sidewalk heating up in the sun is also a physical change, as the sidewalk's material remains the same despite the temperature increase.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n- Both are only physical changes: Correct, as both changes do not alter the fundamental nature of the substances involved.\n- Both are chemical changes: Incorrect, as neither change results in new substances.\n- Both are caused by heating: Incorrect, as only the sidewalk heating up is caused by heating.\n- Both are caused by cooling: Incorrect, as neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C."

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. This means that the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state, so it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed. Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. A puddle freezing is caused by cooling, but shaking up salad dressing is not.\n\nThe answer is D."

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change.

In the context of African lions, lionesses in a pride give birth around the same time and help raise each other's cubs. This cooperation involves feeding and protecting the cubs, which is crucial for their survival. Male lions not part of the pride may attack and kill cubs to take over the pride. However, when multiple lionesses are present, the cubs are better protected and less likely to be killed in such attacks. Therefore, raising cubs with other lionesses increases the chances that the lioness's cubs will survive these attacks, enhancing her reproductive success. The answer is B."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter. Plants making food is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C."

Naomi noticed that the ball traveled farther when she pulled the sling back more. She wondered how much farther the ball would travel for each additional inch she pulled the sling back.\nNaomi launched the ball from the slingshot six times and measured how far the ball traveled each time. On the first two launches, she pulled the sling back four inches. On the next two launches, she pulled the sling back five inches.

For example, a slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound, and a small car has a mass of about 1 ton. Therefore, the best estimate for the mass of a can of soup is 14 ounces. The answer is B."

The allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f). Therefore, a rabbit with at least one F allele will have black fur, while a rabbit with two f alleles will have brown fur.\n\nMickey has the genotype ff, meaning Mickey has two recessive alleles for the fur color gene.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating.

The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes.

For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change.

Cracking open a peanut is also a physical change because the peanut shell breaks and the peanut falls out, but both are still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.

Over time, European colonization led to the establishment of Spanish and French colonies, which eventually became the Dominican Republic and Haiti, respectively. Today, these two countries have distinct languages and cultures. The answer is A."

Max needed to decide how many panels to install and which side of the roof to install them on. If he put the panels on the side that got the most sun, then he could use fewer panels, and the client would save money. Max installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof. Then, he measured the amount of sunlight the sensors on each side of the roof recorded over one sunny summer day.\nFigure: installing solar panels on a roof.\nOptions: (A) the amount of sunlight the roof would get throughout the year (B) which side of the roof got more sun over one day (C) how many solar panels could fit on each side of the roof\n<image>"

The roseate spoonbill has a long spoon-shaped beak, which is not adapted to tear through meat. The roseate spoonbill uses its beak to filter through mud for invertebrates and small fish.\n\nThe answer is B."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating, where the paper reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating, where ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change because the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter. Burning a marshmallow is also a chemical change because the heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change, making it black and crispy.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, not physical changes. Both are chemical changes: Both changes are chemical changes, where the type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating: Burning is caused by heating, but a piece of avocado turning brown is not. Both are caused by cooling: Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns, changing into ash and smoke.\n\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change and can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Stretching a rubber band is a physical change; the rubber band gets longer but remains the same type of matter. Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state, a physical change where liquid water changes into gas without forming a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes, and no new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Water evaporating is caused by heating, but stretching a rubber band is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is D."

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\n\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies! A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating.

Conversely, if the magnitudes differ, the forces are unbalanced, creating a net force.\n\nIn this scenario, Earth's gravity pulls Dominic down with a force of 400 N, and the diving board pushes him up with an equal force of 400 N. Since these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they are balanced.\n\nThe answer is B."

In this case, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent.\n\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent, using the formula: concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent.\n\nIn Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, we need to consider both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Cooking chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter. Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Cooking is caused by heating. But a penny tarnishing is not. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is B."

These genes can have different alleles that cause variations in traits. For instance, in pea plants, the gene for flower color has two alleles: F for purple flowers and f for white flowers. A plant's genotype is its combination of alleles, such as FF, Ff, or ff, which determines its phenotype, or observable trait.\n\nAn organism with two identical alleles is homozygous, while one with two different alleles is heterozygous. Dominant alleles, like F, cause their trait to appear even if a recessive allele is present. Recessive alleles, like f, only show their trait if no dominant allele is present.\n\nIn the context of coat color in cows, the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l). Dasher's genotype is ll, meaning Dasher has two recessive alleles. Since the l allele is recessive and there are no dominant L alleles present, Dasher's phenotype must be a red coat.\n\nThe answer is B."

An exclamatory sentence expresses strong emotion or surprise and ends with an exclamation point.\n\nThe given sentence, \"Wow, that was a loud sneeze!\" expresses surprise and ends with an exclamation point. Therefore, it is an exclamatory sentence.\n\nThe answer is B."

Conversely, when resources cost more or are harder to get, or when there are fewer producers or suppliers, the supply tends to go down.\n\nIn this case, the number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Sparrowtown decreased from seven to three, meaning there are fewer suppliers. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, the supply of men's shirts probably went down. The answer is A."

The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nOptions: (A) They are shy animals that usually hide in tall grass. (B) They are wild guinea pigs that live in mountain forests.

Each plant has two alleles for this gene, one from each parent, resulting in genotypes like FF, Ff, or ff. The phenotype is the observable trait, such as purple or white flowers, depending on the genotype.\n\nIn the context of Thomsen disease, the gene has two alleles: M for having the disease and m for not having it. Ellen has Thomsen disease and has two alleles for the disease (M). Therefore, Ellen's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is MM.\n\nThe answer is B."

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules, and the atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules, such as carbon dioxide.\n\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, which can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass, meaning the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\n\nStep 1: Think about each change. Picking up a paper clip with a magnet is a physical change. The paper clip sticks to the magnet, but it is still made of the same type of matter. Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces, but each piece is still made of the same type of matter.\n\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling.\n\nThe answer is C."

Look closely at the last three properties:\n\n- Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\n- A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\n- A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. For instance, brightly colored skin can serve as a warning sign to predators. The sharpnose-puffer has a poisonous body with brightly colored skin, signaling its toxicity to potential predators.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to identify which animal has a similar adaptation. The opalescent nudibranch has stinging cells in its brightly colored skin, which serves as a warning sign to ward off predators. In contrast, the fantastic leaf-tailed gecko has reddish-brown skin that does not serve as a warning sign. \n\nThe answer is A."
